=={{anchor|concepts}}Basic concepts: axis, steps, embrace.==

==={{anchor|body_position}}Body position and basic steps===

Position-related concepts of Argentine tango are axis and off-axis positions. Body position in which legs are approximately perpendicular to the floor is called 'axis' and there are two axis positions associated with one of two legs.<ref name=balmaceda_basics/> Off-axis positions are called apile (apilado, carpa, volcada) or colgada.<ref name=gustavo_rosas1/> The center of balance moves outside one's body in case of the off-axis moves.

=={{anchor|embrace_and_styles}}Embrace and styles==
Argentine tango dancing consists of a variety of styles that developed in different regions and eras and in response to the crowding of the venue and even the fashions in clothing. It is danced in an embrace that can vary from very open, in which the dancers connect at arms length, to very closed, in which the connection is chest-to-chest, or anywhere in between. Styles of dance are ''not predefined'' by the embrace itself and many figures of tango salon style are danced in an open embrace, it is also possible to dance [[tango nuevo]] in close V-shape embrace.  The milonguero (apilado) style is an exception; its close embrace without V-shape and emphasis on maintaining this embrace throughout the dance predetermines range of possible movements and their [[#Variants and shape|shape]].

==={{anchor|dance_embrace}}Dance embraces===
{|class="wikitable sortable"
|-
!Spanish!!English!!Associated styles||Description – Embrace and styles!!class="unsortable"|Image!!class="unsortable"|Image
|-
|{{anchor|close_embrace}}Abrazo cerrado||V-shape close embrace||Salon and tango nuevo||The dancers' chests are closer to each other than their hips, and often there is contact at about the level of the chest (the contact point differing, depending on the height of the leader and the closeness of the embrace). In [[close embrace]], the leader and the follower's chests are in contact and they are dancing with their heads touching or very near each other. ||[[File:Homer tango embrace close full.JPG|100px]] || [[File:Homer tango embrace close.jpg|100px]]
|-
|{{anchor|Open_embrace}}Abrazo abierto||Open embrace||Tango nuevo, salon||In open embrace, there can be as much space as desired between the partners, but there should always be complete contact along the embracing arms to give optimum communication. Argentine tango dancers do not hold their upper bodies arched away from each other; each partner is over their own axis. Whether open or closed, a tango embrace is not rigid, but relaxed, like a hug. || [[File:Homer tango embrace open full.JPG|100px]] ||[[File:Homer tango embrace open part.jpg|100px]]
|-
|{{anchor|apilado}}Apilado (estilo milonguero, estilo del centro [de Buenos Aires])||Square close embrace||Style milonguero||Milonguero style of embrace is danced in closed position, chest-to-chest, with the partners leaning – or appearing to lean – slightly toward each other to allow space for the feet to move. The follower's left arm position on the leader's shoulder is a style issue. It originates and is used in crowded milongas where there is so much people that you're literally dancing in "square". In those places the lifted arm avoids touching and accidentally hurting other people during turns. Close embrace, no V-shape.|| [[File:Homer tango embrace millonguero.jpg|100px]]||[[File:Homer2 tango milonguero part.JPG|100px]]
|-
|{{anchor|tango_al_reves}}Tango al reves, doble frente||Reverse embrace||Tango salon and nuevo|| Reverse embrace where both partners face the same direction; it is now used only occasionally to perform tango figures (see [[#doble frente|doble frente]]). ||[[File:Homer2 tango al reves1.JPG|100px]]||[[File:Homer2 tango al reves.JPG|100px]]

==={{anchor|practice_embraces}}Practice embraces===

=={{anchor|walk_and_salidas}}Walk and salidas==

==={{anchor|walking_systems}}Walking systems===
Walking in a cross system is defined as the couple stepping simultaneously with their two right legs and stepping simultaneously with their two left legs.  Walking in a parallel system is defined as the couple stepping simultaneously with the leader's right and follower's left leg, and then with the leader's left and the follower's right leg. When dancers are facing each other, the cross system results in an anti-mirror effect.  For this reason, in ballroom tango cross system is never used unless both dancers are facing the same direction. Argentine tango, however, makes extensive use of the cross system with dancers facing each other.  In Argentine tango, the leader can change his weight from one foot to another while the follower's weight remains unchanged; this is the simplest method of changing from parallel system to cross system or vice versa. By contrast in ballroom tango, a weight change by one partner leads to an automatic weight change by the other.

The cross system and parallel system walk nomenclature originated with the Naveira/Salas "Investigation Group." Early on, they used 'even/uneven' to describe the arrangement of legs in the walk or turn. By the mid-1990s, they began using 'parallel/crossed' and later 'normal/crossed'. The process of changing from the parallel system to cross system (or vice versa) by having the leader change weight without the follower changing weight (or vice versa) is named ''contrapaso'', or "contra-step". This change can be made off or on the normal beat.

|-
|}

==={{anchor|basic_step}}Eight count basic (8CB)===
Basic step (paso básico, basico cuadrado y cruzado)  is used for education purposes and almost never danced as a basic step of tango. For this reason it is sometimes called pejoratively academic basic.  Nevertheless, it contains basic elements of the dance. Also, it serves a purpose of "establishing notation" to more complex tango elements. Basic step (eight count basic, 8CB) is composed of back step, side step, cross for the lady (leader steps outside of his partner with his right leg), forward step, and side step. Basic steps can also be divided into four phases: salida – position 1 and 2 and transition from position 2 to position 3; caminata (position 3 and 4), cross (position 5), and resolution (positions 6,7,8). There are variants of the basic step.

|}
Baldosa (tile) or cuadrado (square) is a six-step figure similar to the ballroom box step except the man starts with his right foot, then steps back, side, forward, forward, side, feet together; the baldosa is the basic step of milonga. This baldosa is similar to eight count basic with the exception of the cross.

Some Argentine tango teachers teach complex figures but break them down into simpler parts. Subsequently, they teach students how to improvise their own figures. Beginner classes may include caminada – combination of caminar (walk), cross, and ochos. The beginning part of a figure, its starting-point, is called salida (exit or beginning – as in "beginning of a journey"). The end part of a figure is called resolución. Combination of the salida, a walk, the cross of the lady and the resolución is called basic step (paso basico, la base, salida simple).

Thus, an Argentine tango figure is the pattern of salida, combination of elements, and resolución. This makes for flexible, ever-changing patterns. It gives leader an exceptional opportunity to improvise, and in part makes the Argentine tango unique in the dance world.

==={{anchor|decorations}} Follower's technique and embellishments===
As in many dances most spectators focus on the follower – her elegance, grace, music interpretation as well as technique. Even though these are highly individual attributes there are some accepted ideas of what makes a follower graceful and beautiful when dancing tango. Such skills include leg projection and weight transfer,  stability in movements, elegance in leg placement and leg extension, pivoting, embellishments, as well as expression of emotions.

==={{anchor|variants_and_shape}}Variants and shape===
Tango elements come in a variety of shapes determined by, for example, elasticity or flexion of the execution of movement. Such variants gives a figure a more modern or traditional look, it can be an expression of the follower's creativity, or simple adjustment to how crowded is the floor.

Many tango steps are often borrowed from tango shows, but modified for the tight spaces and flow of other dancers around the floor. Many of these steps are part of [[tango nuevo]]. The shape of the steps can vary – for example, how the follower's body is curved during the step may change according to her interpretation of the music or the moment. There are several instructional videos illustrating sequences of tango nuevo such as colgadas and volcadas with elements of traditional tango.,<ref name=gustavo_rosas1/><ref name=gustavo_rosas2/><ref name=gustavo_rosas3/>
