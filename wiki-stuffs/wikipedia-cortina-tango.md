A '''cortina''' (curtain) is a short piece (20â€“60 seconds) of music that is played between [[tanda (tango)|tandas]] at a [[milonga (place)|milonga]] (tango dance event).<ref>Beatriz Dujovne ''In Strangers' Arms: The Magic of the Tango'' 2011 Page 62 "When the 15-minute tanda of four dances is over, and the cortina (interlude) music plays,..."</ref>  The cortina lets the dancers know that the tanda has ended. The partners can then thank each other and return to their own tables, to find a new dance partner at the next tanda. Cortinas are used at many of the milongas in Argentina and Uruguay and increasingly elsewhere.
