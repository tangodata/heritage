'''Milonga''' is a musical genre that originated in the [[Río de la Plata]] areas of [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]]. It was very popular in the 1870s. It was derived from an earlier style of singing known as the ''[[payada]] de contrapunto''. The song was set to a lively {{music|time|2|4}} [[Time signature|tempo]], as are most milongas.

"Milonga is an excited [[habanera (music)|habanera]]." The original habanera divided into four pulses, in a standard two-four where [[staccatissimo|every note was stressed]]. In becoming milonga, though, all four notes turned strong, as tempo was doubled. The strength of the first beat weakened the fourth giving an almost waltz-like feel to milonga: one-two-three(four), one-two-three(four).
Habanera is a slower, more explicit sounding ''one'', two, ''three''-four. At least one modern tango pianist believes the [[polka]] influenced the speeding up of the milonga.<ref>Robert Thompson. "Tango the Art History of Love" page 129</ref>

Milonga has a [[Syncopation|syncopated]] beat, consisting of 8 beats with accents on the 1st (sometimes also 2nd), 4th, 5th, and 7th beats.

Over time, dance steps and other musical influences were added, eventually giving rise to the [[Tango (dance)|tango]].

By the 1890s musicians were writing in a structured form that was something more than thinly disguised ''milongas'' or ''tangos andaluces'', and would later become the fully developed tango.<ref>Tango!
