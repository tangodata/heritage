'''Ballroom tango''' is a [[ballroom dance]] that branched away from its original [[Argentine tango|Argentine roots]] by allowing European, American, Hollywood, and competitive influences into the style and execution of the dance.

The present day ballroom tango is divided into two disciplines: [[Glossary of partner dance terms#American Style|American Style]] and [[Glossary of partner dance terms#International Style|International Style]].  Both styles may be found in social and competitive dances, but the International version is more globally accepted as a competitive style.  Both styles share a [[Glossary of partner dance terms#Closed position|closed dance position]], but the American style allows its practitioners to separate from closed position to execute [[Glossary of partner dance terms#Open position|open moves]], like underarm turns, alternate hand holds, dancing apart, and side-by-side choreography.

===American style tango===
American style tangoâ€™s evolutionary path is derived from Argentina to the United States, when it was popularized by silent film star [[Rudolph Valentino]] in 1921, who demonstrated a highly stylized form of Argentine tango in ''[[The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (film)|The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]]''.  As a result, the Hollywood style steps mixed in with other social dance steps of the times began this branch away from the Argentine style.  Meanwhile, the tango was also making its own inroads into Europe.

Following the English standardization of their version of tango, [[Arthur Murray]], a ballroom dance instructor in the U.S., tried his own hand at standardizing the ballroom dances for instruction in his chain of social dance schools.<ref>[http://www.coloradodancestudios.com/history_of_arthur_murray.HTM Arthur Murray Ballroom Dance Studios - History of Arthur Murray<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This looser social style was referred to as American style by the English.

In 1912 tango was introduced to British audiences, showcased in the successful musical comedy ''[[The Sunshine Girl]]''. Concurrently, the dance became popular elsewhere in Europe, particularly in Paris.<ref>[[Christine Denniston|Denniston, Christine]]. 2003.

Retrieved on October 26, 2009.</ref> and Europeans began to inject their own culture, style and technique into the dance.

In an effort to teach a standardized version of the tango, the English eventually codified their own version of tango for instruction in dance schools and for performance in competitions in 1922.  The resulting style was referred to as English style, but eventually took on the name International style, as this became the competitive ballroom version practiced around the world.

Eventually, championships in the international style tango were organized all over Europe with numerous participating countries.  Adjudicators were able to judge against a standardized syllabus and book of techniques, thereby creating a more objective means of picking the champions, even though artistic interpretation remains an important element of competition.<ref>[http://www.wright-house.com/dance/istd-international-standard-syllabus-ballroom-dance.html#tango ISTD International Standard Syllabus, Ballroom Dance: Waltz, Quickstep, Tango, Foxtrot, Viennese Waltz<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Initially, the English dominated the International style tango, but eventually, technicians from other backgrounds, most notably the Italians, have chipped away at the English standard and created a dynamic style that continues to raise the competitive bar.<ref>[http://www.dance-forums.com/directory/articles/article-5.html List of Blackpool Professional Standard Champions<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
