'''Milonga''' is an event where [[Argentine tango]] is danced. The venue dedicated to milongas may also be called "milonga". People who frequently go to milongas may be called ''[[milonguero]]s''.

The music played is mainly [[Tango music|tango]], [[Vals Criollo|vals]] and [[Milonga (music)|milonga]]. Most milongas are held on a regular basis (usually weekly), and they often begin with dancing classes and sometimes demonstration dances. Usually, three to five songs of a kind are played in a row (this is called ''[[tanda (tango)|tanda]]'') followed by a short musical break (called ''[[cortina (tango)|cortina]]'') to clear the dance floor and facilitate partner changes. There are a number of informal rules that dictate how dancers should choose their dancing partners and navigate the floor.<ref>{{cite web|title=Example of rules or "codigos" of tango|url=http://www.siempremilonguero.org/tango-codigos-codes/|accessdate=20 February 2015}}</ref>
