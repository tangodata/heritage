==Etymology==
There are numbers of theories about the origin of the word "tango". One of the more popular in recent years has been that it came from the [[Niger–Congo]] languages of Africa.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=vN4M7XZgD-cC&printsec=frontcover Slavery and Beyond: The African Impact on Latin America and the Caribbean, page 122] {{ISBN|0-8420-2485-9}}</ref><ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tango Online Etymology Dictionary]</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Argentina Reader: History, Culture, Politics|author= Gabriela Nouzeilles, Graciela R.

==Origin of the dance==
The dance derives from the Cuban [[Habanera (music)|habanera]], the Argentine [[Milonga (dance)|milonga]] and Uruguayan [[candombe]], and is said to contain elements from the [[Afro-Argentine|African]] community in Buenos Aires, influenced both by ancient African rhythms and the music from Europe.

Even though the present forms developed in Argentina and Uruguay from the mid 19th century, <ref>Several paintings by the Uruguayan artist Pedro Figari (1861-1938) dating from the 19th Century depict tango being danced there.</ref>  there are earlier written records of Tango dances in [[Cuba]] and Spain,<ref name=Pichardo>Esteban Pichardo, ''Diccionario Provincial de Voces Cubanas'' (Matanzas, Imprenta de la Real Marina, 1836, Pg. 242)</ref><ref name=OrtizOrigen>José Luis Ortiz Nuevo ''El origen del tango americano''  Madrid and La Habana 1849</ref> while there is a flamenco [[Tango (flamenco)|Tangos]] dance that may share a common ancestor in a minuet-style European dance.<ref name="DennistonCouple"/> All sources stress the influence of the African communities and their rhythms, while the instruments and techniques brought in by European immigrants played a major role in its final definition, relating it to the [[Salon music]] styles to which Tango would contribute back at a later stage, when it became fashionable in early 20th century Paris.

In Argentina, the word ''Tango'' seems to have first been used in the 1890s. In 1902 the [[Teatro Opera]] started to include tango in their [[Ball (dance)|balls]].<ref name=RGB>[http://www.todotango.com.ar/English/biblioteca/cronicas/origenes_del_tango.asp Reflections about the origins of tango], Ricardo García Blaya</ref> Initially tango was just one of the many available local dances, but it soon became popular throughout society, as theatres and street [[barrel organ]]s spread it from the suburbs to the working-class slums, which were packed with hundreds of thousands of European [[immigrant]]s.  The development of Tango had influences from the cultures of several peoples that came together in these [[melting pot]]s of ethnicities. For this reason Tango is often referred to as the music of the immigrants to Argentina.<ref name=DennistonCouple />

During the period 1903–1910 over a third of the 1,000 [[gramophone records]] released were of tango music, and tango [[sheet music]] sold in large quantities.<ref name=RGB/> In 1910 the [[bandoneon]] was introduced to Buenos Aires from Germany and it became linked inextricably with tango music from then on. In 1912, Juan "Pacho" Maglio was very popular with his recorded tangos featuring the bandoneon accompanied by flute, violin and guitar. Between 1910 and 1920, tango featured on 2,500 of the 5,500 records released.

By 1912, dancers and musicians from [[Buenos Aires]] travelled to Europe and the first European tango craze took place in Paris, soon followed by London, Berlin, and other capitals. Towards the end of 1913 it hit New York in the USA, and Finland. These exported versions of Tango were modified to have less body contact ("Ballroom Tango"); however, the dance was still thought shocking by many, as had earlier been the case with dances such as the [[Waltz]]. In 1922 guidelines were first set for the "English" (international) style of ballroom tango, but it lost popularity in Europe to new dances including the [[Foxtrot (dance)|Foxtrot]] and [[Samba (ballroom)|Samba]], and as dancing as a whole declined due to the growth of [[film|cinema]].

As the dance form became wildly popular with upper and middle classes around the world, Argentine high society adopted the previously low-class dance form as their own. In 1913, tango began to move from the dark side of town to elegant dance palaces. In 1916, [[Roberto Firpo]], an extremely successful bandleader of the period, cemented the arrangements for standard tango sextet: two [[bandoneon]]s, two violins, piano and double [[Double bass|bass]]. Firpo heard a march by Uruguayan [[Gerardo Matos Rodríguez]] and adapted it for tango, creating the popular and iconic ''[[La Cumparsita]]''.<ref name=DennistonIntro>[http://www.totaltango.com/acatalog/tango_brief_intro_91.html Denniston, Christine. ''A Brief Introduction to the History of Tango Music'']</ref>

In 1917, folk singer [[Carlos Gardel]] recorded his first tango song ''Mi Noche Triste'', forever associating tango with the feeling of tragic love as revealed in the lyric. During the first decade of the 20th century, some songs under the name of tango were recorded, but these recordings did not achieve great popularity. However, in 1921, 'El Sonido de la Milonga' helped bring about the rise of tango, and introduced it properly as a form to the people.

Classically trained musicians weren't associated with tango music until [[Julio De Caro]], violinist, formed an orchestra in 1920 and made the tango more elegant, complex and refined, as well as slowing the [[tempo]] somewhat. With [[Pedro Laurenz]] on bandoneon, De Caro's orchestra was famous for over a decade.<ref name=DennistonIntro/>

In Argentina, the onset in 1929 of the [[Great Depression]] and restrictions introduced after the overthrow of the [[Hipólito Yrigoyen]] government in 1930 caused Tango to decline. Its fortunes were reversed as tango became widely fashionable and a matter of national pride under the government of [[Juan Perón]]. Tango declined again in the 1950s with economic [[recession]] and the banning of public gatherings by the military [[dictator]]ships. It should be noted that male-only Tango dancers used to practice among themselves for up to 3 years prior to their debut (going to a public [[Milonga (place)]]<ref name="Tango History">{{cite web|last=Denniston|first=Christine|title=The History of Tango Dance|url=http://www.history-of-tango.com/|publisher=Self|accessdate=7 May 2012}}</ref>), and that practice fell under the prohibition of public gatherings. One of the results was that [[rock and roll]] became more popular because it did not require males' gatherings.

The dance lived on in smaller venues until its revival in the 1980s following the opening in Paris of the show ''[[Tango Argentino (musical)|Tango Argentino]]'', The Broadway [[musical theater|musical]] ''Forever Tango'', and in Europe ''Tango Pasión.''

A little known variant that has never become popular is the lasagnette, in which the positions of the partners are reversed.  It was first performed in the Argentine embassy in London by Lord Dritz the Elder and his bride, Johanna, at the celebration marking the end of the Argentina-Britain Falkland Island conflict. According to the Lord's grand nephew, an American residing in Florida, the dance position was related to the Lord's affliction with dyslexia as a young child.
