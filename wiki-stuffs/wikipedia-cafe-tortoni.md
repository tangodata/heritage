The '''Café Tortoni''' is a [[coffeehouse]] located at 825 [[Avenida de Mayo]] in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]. Inaugurated in 1858 by a [[France|French]] immigrant whose surname was Touan, it was named ''Tortoni'' after the [[Paris]]ian café of the same name located on ''[[Boulevard des Italiens]]'' (where the elite of the ''Parissiense'' culture gathered in the 19th century). The café itself was Inspired by [[Fin de siècle]] coffee houses. Café Tortoni was selected by UCityGuides as one of the ten most beautiful cafes in the world.<ref>[http://www.ucityguides.com/cities/top-10-cafes.html "Top 10: Most BEAUTIFUL CAFES in the World,"] UCityGuides.

==History==
[[File:Café.Tortoni.-.Inside.jpg|thumb|left|250px|View of the interior.]]
The space the café currently occupies was previously the location of the ''Templo Escocés'' ("Scottish Temple"), and the ''Tortoni'' was located on the corner of Rivadavia and Esmeralda. In 1880 it moved to its present location, but had its entrance on the other side of the block in Rivadavia Street. In 1898 the entrance on Avenida de Mayo was opened, and the facade was redesigned by architect [[Alejandro Christophersen]]. At the end of the 19th-century the café was bought by another Frenchman, Celestino Curutchet.

In the basement, ''La Peña'' (see [[peña (music)|peña]]) was inaugurated in 1926, which fomented the protection of the arts and literature until its disintegration in 1943. Among its visitors were [[Alfonsina Storni]], [[Baldomero Fernández Moreno]], [[Juana de Ibarbourou]], [[Arthur Rubinstein]], [[Ricardo Vines]], [[Roberto Arlt]], [[José Ortega y Gasset]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Molina Campos]], and [[Benito Quinquela Martín]].

Over the years the ''café'' has been visited by many renowned people including politicians [[Lisandro de la Torre]] and [[Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear]], popular idols [[Carlos Gardel]] and [[Juan Manuel Fangio]], international figures like [[Albert Einstein]], [[Federico García Lorca]], [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Robert Duvall]] and [[Juan Carlos de Borbón]].

Currently the basement works as stage for [[jazz]] and [[tango (music)|tango]] artists, and for the presentation of book and poetry contests.  The ''café'' has conserved the decoration of its early years, has a library and at the back facilities to play [[billiards]], [[dominoes]] and [[dice]].
