'''Argentine tango''' is a [[musical genre]] and accompanying [[social dance]] originating at the end of the 19th century in the suburbs of [[Buenos Aires]] <ref name="Denniston-1" /> and [[Montevideo]]. It typically has a [[Time signature|{{music|time|2|4}} or {{music|time|4|4}}]] rhythmic [[time signature]], and two or three parts repeating in patterns such as ABAB or ABCAC. Its lyrics are marked by ''[[nostalgia]]'', sadness, and laments for lost love. The [[Orquesta típica|typical orchestra]]  has several melodic instruments and is given a distinctive air by the small button [[accordion]] called the [[bandoneon]]. It has continued to grow in popularity and spread internationally, adding modern elements without replacing the older ones. Among its leading figures are the singer and songwriter [[Carlos Gardel]] and composers/performers [[Francisco Canaro]], [[Juan D'Arienzo]], [[Carlos di Sarli|Carlos Di Sarli]], [[Osvaldo Pugliese]], and [[Ástor Piazzolla]].

==History of tango==
{{main|History of the tango}}
The origins of tango are unclear because little historical documentation from that era exists. However, in recent years, a few tango aficionados have undertaken a thorough research of that history<ref name="Denniston-1">{{cite web|last1=Denniston|first1=Christine|title=The Hidden History of Tango|url=http://www.history-of-tango.com/|website=The Hidden History of Tango|accessdate=30 September 2014}}</ref> and so it is less mysterious today than before. It is generally thought that the dance developed in the late 19th century in working-class neighborhoods of Buenos Aires, Argentina and Montevideo, Uruguay and was practiced by Uruguayan and Argentine dancers, musicians, and immigrant laborers.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=szmYo-voZJEC&pg=PR14 |page=14 |title=Instrumental Tango Idioms in the Symphonic Works and Orchestral Arrangements of Astor Piazzolla.

==Music==
{{main|Tango music}}
Argentine tango music is much more varied than ballroom tango music. A large amount of tango music has been composed by a variety of different orchestras over the last century. Not only is there a large volume of music, there is a breadth of stylistic differences between these orchestras as well, which makes it easier for Argentine tango dancers to spend the whole night dancing only Argentine tango. The four representative schools of the Argentine tango music are [[Carlos di Sarli|Di Sarli]], [[Juan d'Arienzo|d'Arienzo]], [[Aníbal Troilo|Troilo]] and [[Osvaldo Pugliese|Pugliese]], all four descendent from Italian immigrant families. They are dance orchestras, playing music for dancing. When the spirit of the music is characterized by counterpoint marking, clarity in the articulation is needed. It has a clear, repetitive pulse or beat, a strong tango-rhythm which is based on the 2x4,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://users.pandora.be/Tango-E-Vita/tango/Caminar.htm |title='Caminar' |publisher=Users.pandora.be |date=2008-08-25 |accessdate=2010-03-15}}</ref> 2 strong beats on 4 (dos por cuatro). [[Ástor Piazzolla]] stretched the classical harmony and counterpoint and moved the tango from the dance floor to the concert stage. His compositions tell us something of our contemporary life and dancing it relates much to modern dance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://users.pandora.be/Tango-E-Vita/tangoiste/TANGOkinesis.htm |title=Tango and modern dance' |publisher=Users.pandora.be |date=2007-06-23 |accessdate=2010-03-15| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080502132020/http://users.pandora.be/Tango-E-Vita/tangoiste/TANGOkinesis.htm| archivedate=May 2, 2008<!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

While Argentine tango dancing has historically been danced to tango music, such as that produced by such orchestra leaders as [[Osvaldo Pugliese]], [[Carlos di Sarli]], [[Juan d'Arienzo]], in the '90s a younger generation of tango dancers began dancing tango steps to alternatives to tango music; music from other genres like, "world music", "electro-tango", "experimental rock", "trip hop", and "blues", to name a few. Tango nuevo dance is often associated with alternative music, see [[nuevo tango]], but it can be danced to tango as well.

[[File:Tango au01.JPG|thumb|right|Argentine tango in the streets of [[San Telmo, Buenos Aires|San Telmo]], Buenos Aires.]]
Argentine tango dancing consists of a variety of styles that developed in different regions and eras, and in response to the crowding of the venue and even the fashions in clothing. Even though the present forms developed in Argentina and Uruguay, they were also exposed to influences re-imported from Europe and North America. There are records of 18th and early 19th century tango styles in [[Cuba]] and Spain,<ref name=OrtizOrigen>José Luis Ortiz Nuevo ''El origen del tango americano"  Madrid y La Habana 1849</ref> while there is a [[flamenco]] [[tango (flamenco)|tangos]] dance that may share a common ancestor in a minuet-style European dance.<ref name=DennistonCouple>{{cite web|url=http://www.history-of-tango.com/couple-dancing.html |title=Christine Denniston. 'Couple Dancing and the Beginning of Tango' 2003 |publisher=History-of-tango.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100425054148/http://www.history-of-tango.com/couple-dancing.html| archivedate= 25 April 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Consequently, there is a good deal of confusion and overlap between the styles as they are now danced - and fusions continue to evolve.

Argentine tango is danced in an embrace that can vary from very open, in which leader and follower connect at arms length, to very closed, in which the connection is chest-to-chest, or anywhere in between.

Tango dance is essentially walking with a partner and the music. Dancing appropriately to the emotion and speed of a tango is extremely important to dancing tango. A good dancer is one who transmits a feeling of the music to the partner, leading them effectively throughout the dance. Also, dancers generally keep their feet close to the floor as they walk, the ankles and knees brushing as one leg passes the other.

Argentine tango dancing relies heavily on [[improvisation]]; although certain patterns of movement have been codified by instructors over the years as a device to instruct dancers, there is a "basic step" called "basico". One of the few constants across all Argentine tango dance styles is that the follower will usually be led to alternate feet. Another is that the follower rarely has his or her weight on both feet at the same time. In many modern variations of Argentine Tango, particularly in Europe, teachers of Tango may establish a "basic step" in order to help students to learn and pick up the "feel" of the dance.

{{Howto|date=March 2010}}
Argentine tango is danced counterclockwise around the outside of the dance floor (the "line of dance") and dance "traffic" often segregates into a number of "lanes"; cutting across the middle of the floor is frowned upon. In general, the middle of the floor is where one finds either beginners who lack floor navigation skills or people who are performing "showy" figures or patterns that take up more dance floor space. It is acceptable to stop briefly in the line of dance to perform stationary figures, as long as the other dancers are not unduly impeded. The school of thought about this is, if there is open space in front, there are likely people waiting behind. Dancers are expected to respect the other couples on the floor; colliding or even crowding another couple, or stepping on others' feet is to be avoided strenuously. It is considered rude; in addition to possible physical harm rendered, it can be disruptive to a couple's musicality.

[[Tango (ballroom)|Ballroom tango]] steps were standardized by dance studios. The steps have been relatively fixed in style for decades. However, Argentine tango has been an evolving dance and musical form, with continual changes occurring every day on the social dance floor in Argentina and in major tango centers elsewhere in the world. Argentine tango dance is, still based heavily on improvisation. While there are patterns or sequences of steps that are used by instructors to teach the dance, even in a sequence every movement is led not only in direction but also speed and quality (a step can be smooth, pulsing, sharp, ... etc.). Although Argentine tango evolves mostly on the dance floor, the government of Argentina does host an annual competition of Argentine tango dance in [[Buenos Aires]], attracting competitors from around the world.

[[File:Homer tango embrace close.jpg|thumb|150px|Close embrace]]

===Elements===

====Embrace====
A striking difference between Argentine tango and ballroom tango is in the shape and feel of the embrace. Ballroom technique dictates that partners arch their upper bodies away from each other, while maintaining contact at the hip, in an offset frame.

In Argentine tango, it is nearly the opposite: the dancers' chests are closer to each other than are their hips, and often there is contact at about the level of the chest (the contact point differing, depending on the height of the leader and the closeness of the embrace). In [[close embrace]], the leader and the follower's chests are in contact and they are dancing with their heads touching or very near each other. In open embrace, there can be as much space as desired between the partners, but there should always be complete contact along the embracing arms to give optimum communication. Since Argentine tango is almost entirely improvisational, there needs to be clear communication between partners. Even when dancing in a very open embrace, Argentine tango dancers do not hold their upper bodies arched away from each other; yet, each partner is not always over their own axis, there are even styles that demand a constant leaning against each other. Whether open or closed, a tango embrace is not rigid, but relaxed, like a hug.

[[File:Homer tango cross walk.jpg|thumb|150px|Cross system walk.]]
[[File:Homer tango parallel walk.jpg|thumb|150px|Parallel system walk.]]

====Walking====
One characteristic of Argentine tango is the walk outside of the legs of the follower. The inside walk belongs originally to the American Tango. It is seen in Argentine Tango, but it does not belong to it originally {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}. Another difference is that the leader may freely step with his left foot when the follower steps with her left foot. In English, this is sometimes referred to as a "crossed" (e.g. "walking in the crossed system") or "uneven" walk in contrast to the normal walk which is called "parallel" or "even."  In ballroom tango, "crossed system" is considered incorrect unless the leader and follower are facing the same direction {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}. Furthermore, the flexibility of the embrace allows the leader to change his weight from one foot to another while the follower's weight remains unchanged. This is another major difference with ballroom tango, where a weight change by one partner usually leads to a weight change by the other.

The nomenclature originated with the Naveira/Salas "Investigation Group." Early on, they used 'even/uneven' to describe the arrangement of legs in the walk (or turn). By the mid-1990s, they began using 'parallel/crossed' and later 'normal/crossed'. In dance the changing of feet is named ''contrapaso'', or "contra-step". This change can be made off or on the normal beat.

==== Figures ====
{{main|Figures of Argentine tango}}
Unlike the majority of social dances, Argentine tango does not have a basic step; instead is a completely improvised dance combining various elements in a spontaneous manner, as determined by the lead.
To be able to improvise, the dancer needs to learn the lead and implementation of the different single elements of Tango, so they can be produced later by leading appropriately in space and music.
The elements are just a few as ''caminar'' (walk), ''cruce'' (cross), ''ochos'' (figure-eight), ''ganchos'' (leg hooks), ''giros'' (turns), ''contragiros'' (turns in the other direction), ''sacadas'' (displacements), ''boleos'' (this expression comes from boleadoras, balls linked with cords, thrown to hunt animals),  ''llevadas de pie'' (moving foot by foot), ''cortes'' (cuts), and ''quebradas'' (breaks).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tangofolklore.com/tango/modules.php?name=mlContent&pa=showpage&pid=86|title=Tangofolklore - 21|first=|last=Tangofolklore|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tangofolklore.com/tango/modules.php?name=mlContent&pa=showpage&pid=64|title=Tangofolklore - Libro, autora Nicole Nau|first=|last=Tangofolklore|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref> Well-known and simple combinations are called ''figura básica'' (basic figures), especially when they contain just one element. Some of the elements are named as a figure.

[[File:Homer tango cabeceo.JPG|thumb|150px|Cabeceo]]

====Códigos and yeta====
Argentine tango developed set of codes and superstitions throughout its history.

''1. The Invitation to Dance''

An invitation to dance is traditionally done by “cabeceo,” a head nod by one dancer met with eye contact. It is done during a cortina or early in the tanda. The advantage of the cabaceo is that it allows for unwanted dances to be avoided, and prevents any embarrassment that comes with a rejected dance.

''2. How many songs do I dance with my partner?''

Argentine tango is danced in sets of songs, known as a “tanda.” A tanda is a set of three to four songs of one type of music- either tango, vals or milonga. If you accept a dance, you are expected to finish all of the songs with that partner. “Breaking the tanda” is viewed as incredibly rude, and it should not be done. Dancing two or more tandas with the same person is usually not done. It implies interest in your partner, and is seen as a flirtatious act.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tangoconcepts.com/blog/2008/02/different-types-of-tango.html|title=TangoScene:  Argentine Tango Dance by Florentino Guizar: Different Types of Tango|website=www.tangoconcepts.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-13}}</ref>

''3. When does the tanda end? ''

After three to four songs, the tanda is flowed by a “cortina” (curtain). It is traditionally a non-tango song that lasts approximately a minute. During this time the dancers return to their seats.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tangology101.com/main.cfm/title/General-Milonga-Etiquette/id/74|title=General Milonga Etiquette|website=Tangology 101|access-date=2017-07-13}}</ref> Traditionally, it is frowned upon to dance to the music of a cortina.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.tangomuse.com/TangoManners.html|title=Tango Manners|last=herreman|first=tine|website=www.tangomuse.com|access-date=2017-07-13}}</ref>

''4. Give Priority To Those Currently Dancing''

Never walk across the dance floor while people are dancing. When you get up to meet your dance partner, move to the outside edge of the dance floor. It is important to be mindful of those already dancing.

''5. The Right Of Way On The Dance Floor''

Entering the line of dance in a crowded dance floor can be tricky. It is important to establish eye contact with the dancer approaching at your left before you enter the line of dance to avoid collision.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.latangoacademy.com/blog/2015/8/18/tango-etiquette-on-the-dance-floor|title=Tango Etiquette On The Dance Floor|work=Los Angeles Tango Academy {{!}} Dance Classes|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en-US}}</ref>

''6. Distance Between Couples''

Always be mindful of the distance between you and your partner, and the couple ahead of you. Do not dance too closely to the couple ahead of you, or there could be a collision if they make a turn. Conversely, do not allow that distance to become too large. Never move backwards into the space of the couple behind you.

''7. When The Dance Floor Becomes Crowded''

It is important to adapt your movements to the size of the crowd dancing. In a crowded social setting, the follower’s feet should largely remain on the floor in order to avoid hitting anyone. Minimize large sweeping steps to avoid possibly hit another couple.<ref name=":1" />

''8. Small Talk''

It is frowned upon to talk whilst dancing. Small talk is appropriate in between songs, or if you are sitting and not dancing.

''9. Feedback/ teaching''

It is not appropriate to give or receive feedback during Milongas. Correcting someone during this time takes away from the mutual enjoyment of the dance.<ref name=":1" /> Prácticas and classes provide opportunities for this type of interaction.

''10. Yetas''

Somewhat related is "yeta"  - superstitions. For example, one doesn't dance to the well-known tango "[[Adios Muchachos]]" as it is (falsely) <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.todotango.com/english/history/chronicle/130/The-last-tango-that-Gardel-sang/|title=The last tango that Gardel sang|last=Arancio|first=Salvador Arancio|website=todotango.com|access-date=4 April 2016|quote=And next, his last tango and, consequently, the answer for the question that originated this chronicle: “Tomo y obligo”.}}</ref> believed the last one sung by [[Carlos Gardel]] before his untimely accident leading to his death.

''Argentine Tango Etiquette today:''

While many of the códigos largely remain unchanged, the dance continues evolve alongside modernity. In the history of Argentine tango, dancing two or more tandas with the same person was usually not done as it was seen as a flirtatious act. This is one “rule” that is seen as more flexible in the modern era. This is especially true in smaller communities of tango dancers.<ref name=":0" /> Furthermore, tango has adapted to ever-changing fashion styles, and more casual clothing for men and women are accepted, although many make an effort to dress up for Milongas. The music played for cortinas is distinct, and cannot be confused with tango music. In Buenos Aires it is traditionally not acceptable to dance to cortinas. In the United States it is merely awkward to dance to them.<ref name=":0" />

==== Vals and milonga ====
Argentine tango dancers usually enjoy two other related dances: [[vals (dance)|vals]] (valsecito criollo argentino, vals porteño, vals tango) and [[Milonga (dance)|milonga]].

Music for the vals is in 3/4 time. Tango dancers dance the vals in a rather relaxed, smooth flowing dancing style in contrast to [[Viennese Waltz]] where the dancers often take 3 steps per measure and turn almost constantly. Experienced dancers alternate the smooth one-beat-per-measure walk with some double time steps (often incorrectly called syncopated walks), stepping on one- two- or (rarely) all three beats in a measure. Vals dancing is characterized by absence of pauses; continual turns (giros) in both directions are not done as in ballroom quick waltz, although turns are sometimes introduced for variety.

[[Milonga (music)|Milonga]], in 2/4 time, has a strongly accented beat, and sometimes an underlying "[[Contradanza|habanera]]" rhythm. Dancers avoid pausing, and often introduce double time steps (incorrectly called syncopation and more appropriately called ''traspiés'') into their walks and turns. Milonga dancing uses the same basic elements as tango, with a strong emphasis on the rhythm, and figures that tend to be less complex than some danced in other varieties of tango. Some tango instructors say that tango steps should not be used in milonga and that milonga has its own special rhythm and steps, which are quite different from tango.

[[Milonga (dance event)|Milonga]] is also the name given to clubs and events specially for dancing tango. This double meaning of the word milonga can be confusing unless one knows the context in which the word "milonga" is used. People who attend milongas are known as ''[[milonguero]]s''.

===Styles of Argentine tango dance===

==== Tango canyengue ====

Tango canyengue is a rhythmic style of tango that originated in the early 1900s and is still popular today. It is one of the original roots styles of tango and contains all fundamental elements of traditional Argentine tango. In tango canyengue the dancers share one axis, dance in a closed embrace, and with the legs relaxed and slightly bent. Tango canyengue uses body dissociation for the leading, walking with firm ground contact, and a permanent combination of on- and off-beat rhythm.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tangocanyengue.org |title=TangoCanyengue.org |publisher=TangoCanyengue.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302084509/http://www.tangocanyengue.org/ |archivedate=2009-03-02 |df= }}</ref> Its main characteristics are its musicality and playfulness. Its rhythm is described as "incisive, exciting, provocative".<ref>José Sebastián Tallon ''El tango en su etapa de musica prohibida'' 1959</ref>

The word ''canyengue'' comes from the [[Kikongo language]] and means "melting with the music". It came into use to describe the tango rhythm at the time of the first so-called '[[Orquesta típica|orquestas típicas]]' (including [[bandoneón]], violin and piano).<ref>Athus Espindola, ''Diccionario del Lunfardo'' 2002</ref>

* Romolo Garcia (deceased)
* El Negro Celso (deceased)
* Rodolfo Cieri (deceased) and Maria Cieri
* Luis Grondona
* Marta Anton (deceased) and 'El Gallego' Manolo Salvador
* Roxina Villegas and Adrian Griffero

* Omar and Monica Ocampo

{{See also|Movimiento Cultural Canyengue Argentino}}

==== Tango orillero ====

Tango orillero refers to the style of dance that developed away from the town centers, in the outskirts and suburbs where there was more freedom due to more available space on the dance floor. The style is danced in an upright position and uses various embellishments including rapid foot moves, kicks, and even some acrobatics, though this is a more recent development.

==== Salon tango ====

''Tango Salon'' does not refer to a single specific way of dancing tango. Rather, it is literally tango as it is danced socially in the salons (dance halls) of [[Buenos Aires]]. Salon tango was danced throughout the Golden Era of Argentine Tango (1935–1952) when [[Milonga (place)|milongas]] (tango parties) were held in large dance venues and full tango orchestras performed. Salon tango is often characterized by slow, measured, and smoothly executed moves, never moving against the line-of-dance, and respecting the space of other dancers on the floor around them. The emphasis is on precision, smoothness, musicality, good navigation, and following the ''códigos'' (tango etiquette) of the salons. The couple embraces closely, with some variants having a flexible embrace, opening slightly to make room for various figures and closing again for support and poise. The walk is the most important element, and dancers usually walk 60%-70% of the time during a tango song.

When tango became popular again after the end of the Argentine military dictatorships in 1983, this style was resurrected by dancers from the Golden Era:

* Carlitos (Carlos) and Rosa Perez. The legendary teacher couple at Club Sunderlad, Buenos Aires. Almost all World Tango Championship winners have taken lessons from them.
* Carlos Estévez "Petróleo" †
* Gerardo Portalea †
* Jose "El Turco" Brahemcha
* Jose "Lampazo" Vazquez †
* Luis "Milonguita" Lemos †
* Miguel Balmaceda †
* Mingo and Esther Pugliese
* Osvaldo Cartery † and Luisa "Coca" Inés
* Toto Faraldo
* Pedro "Tete" Rusconi †
* Ramón "Finito" Rivera †
* Virulazo †
* In the milongas at Club Sin Rumbo, Sunderland, Club Glorias Argentinas, Salon El Pial and Salon Canning.

One variant of ''Tango Salon'' is the [[Villa Urquiza]] style, named after the northern barrio of [[Buenos Aires]] where the clubs Sin Rumbo and Sunderland are located. Some argentinian dancers or couples who were or are current practitioners and teach the Villa Urquiza style of tango are:

* El Chino Perico (one of the old milongueros)
* María and [[Carlos Rivarola]]
* The Dispari family with Jorge Dispari and Marita 'La Turca' and their daughters Samantha Dispari and [[Geraldine Rojas]] with their respective couples, Santiago Fina and [[Ezequiel Paludi]].
* [[Miguel Angel Zotto]] and [[Milena Plebs]]
* Andrés Laza Moreno
* Osvaldo Zotto† and Lorena Ermocida
* The Rodriguez family with Jorge and Liliana Rodríguez their daughter Malena, and son Javier Rodríguez.
* The Missé family (Andrea Missé †, Sebastián Missé with Andrea Reyero, [[Gabriel Missé]] and Stella Missé)
* Carlos Perez and Rosa Forte
* Fabián Peralta
* Adrián and Amanda Costa. Teaching in Europe. They live in France as of 2014. Studied under Jorge Dispari and Marita 'La Turca'.
* José Luis González (CL) and Paulina Cazabón (CL). They live in Chile as of 2015 and tour in Europe (mainly France).
* Juan Martin Carrara (UY) and Stefania Colina (UY). They live in Uruguay as of 2015 and tour in Europe

* Chiche Nuñez (AR). He lives in Berlin, Germany as of 2015.
* Alper Ergökmen and Selen Sürek. They live in Ankara, Turkey as of 2015 and teach mostly in Europe.
* Ney Melo. He lives in US as of 2015.

==== "Estilo milonguero" (tango apilado/confiteria style; estilo del centro de Buenos Aires) ====
{{Main|Milonguero style}}
This is a close-embrace style named by [[Susana Miller]] in the 1990s.<ref name="Susana Miller">[http://laacademiatango.com/content/quienes-somos Susana Miller], Susana Miller - director of La Academia de Tango</ref> Ideal for crowded dance floors, it is danced chest-to-chest, knees relaxed, back straight, with the partners leaning - or appearing to lean - slightly toward each other to allow space for the feet to move. The center line of the leader's and follower's spines are directly in front of each other, requiring that each dancer turn their head to their left slightly to find space over their partner's right shoulder. The follower's left arm reaches directly up over the leader's shoulder without resting any body weight on the leader's shoulder.  The leader's left hand and the follower's right hand clasp in the same manner as other styles of Argentine Tango, with elbows pointed down (contrasting with elbows up and pointed back as in [[Tango (ballroom)|ballroom tango]]), with little or no pressure applied by the arms or hands.  The leader's right arm is held high across the follower's shoulder blades to help facilitate the upper chest connection, to avoid pulling the follower's lower torso and hips in toward the leader, thus allowing more flexibility of movement in the mid and lower spine and better extension of the follower's legs. In the case of followers that are not tall enough to place their head over the leader's shoulder, it is recommended that the follower's head be turned to the right and touch the left side of the head to the leader's chest, and the follower's left arm may wrap around the outside right arm (although this is generally not preferred as it limits the leader's flexibility of movement, and is a danger on crowded dance floors to have the follower's elbow sticking out). It is generally not recommended for a leader to dance milonguero style with a follower that is too tall for the leader to see over the follower's shoulder since it would be very difficult to navigate around the dance floor.

A style of [[Carlos Espinoza (dancer)|Carlitos Espinoza]] can be considered a modern development of tango milonguero.<ref name="Carlitos-1">{{cite web|title=Noelia HURTADO & Carlitos ESPINOZA|url=http://www.tangoelement.org/node/12|website=Tango Element|accessdate=21 October 2015}}</ref>

==== Tango nuevo ====
{{main|Nuevo tango}}
Starting in the 1990s in [[Buenos Aires]], the ''Tango Investigation Group'' (later transformed into the ''[http://www.cosmotango.com Cosmotango]'' organization) founded by [[Gustavo Naveira]] and [[:es:Fabián Salas|Fabián Salas]]<ref>http://tangodynamics.com/about_fabian_salas</ref> applied the principles of dance [[kinesiology]] from [[modern dance]] to analyze the physics of movement in Argentine tango.  Taking what they learned from this analysis they then began to explore all the possibilities of movement within the framework of Argentine Tango. From the work of these founders of the ''Tango Nuevo'' movement, there was shift in all styles of tango away from teaching what to dance toward teaching how to dance.
<gallery>

File:Homer tango volcada close.jpg|Volcada lead in closed embrace
</gallery>
Though widely referred to as a tango style outside of [[Argentina]], ''Tango Nuevo'' is not considered a style of dancing tango by the founders of the movement.  It refers only to the method of analysis and teaching developed through the application of the principles of dance kinesiology to Argentine Tango.  In 2009, [[Gustavo Naveira]] published an essay ''New Tango'' in which he states, ''"There is great confusion on the question of the way of dancing the tango: call it technique, form, or style. The term ''tango nuevo'', is used to refer to a style of dancing, which is an error. In reality, tango nuevo is everything that has happened with the tango since the 1980s. It is not a question of a style... The words ''tango nuevo'' express what is happening with tango dancing in general; namely that it is evolving."''<ref>Tango, A History of Obsession, Virginia Gift, 2008, {{ISBN|1-4392-1462-X}}  (self published, appeared first in 2009)</ref>  Therefore, as the [[Gustavo Naveira]] and other founders of the ''Tango Nuevo'' movement have said, all styles of tango, which have now been influenced by the analysis of the dance, are all ''Tango Nuevo''.

Despite the insistence by the founders of the ''Tango Nuevo'' movement that it is not a single style, it has become an accepted term by many that it is a separate and distinct style of tango. Practitioners of ''tango nuevo'' are [[Gustavo Naveira]], [[Norberto Esbrez|Norberto "El Pulpo" Esbrés]], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cVlfJQipDY Fabián Salas], [[Sebastián Arce]], [[Mariana Montes]], [[Mariano Frúmboli|Mariano 'Chicho' Frúmboli]], [[Lucía Mazer]], [[Eugenia Parrilla]]. All of these dancers have highly individual styles that cannot be confused with each other, yet are all referred to by many as the ''tango nuevo'' style.

==== Tango traditional ====
A very pure and early form of tango, on base as walking rhythmically, not on the beat but with rhythm.

==== Tango con corte y quebrada ====
Tango which adds cortes and quebradas, cuts and breaks. The quebradas later on has been put in a more esthetic style (estilizar) and are today known as poses de tango, Tango Positions.

==== Tango de fantasía ====
This style mostly evolved over the 1940-1950 time span. The term Tango de Fantasía refers to music, dance, and dresses; it tries to codify a tango form different from the traditional one. Dancers added little sits and fast footwork&nbsp;– doing fantasies, as some people called it. The related men's suit with a white border is named traje de fantasía. In music, Osmar Héctor Maderna's<ref>[http://www.todotango.com/english/creadores/maderna.html todotango.com]</ref> was referred to as Tango de Fantasía due to his arrangements which included fancy solos. During the same time period, people used to refer to the non-traditional Argentinian folklore by a similar expression: Folklore de Proyección.

====Show tango====
[[File:Tango-Show-Buenos-Aires-01.jpg|thumb|200px|A tango show in Buenos Aires]]
Show tango, and Tango de Escenario (stage tango) is a more theatrical form of Argentine tango developed to suit the stage.

In theory, all styles can be performed on stage, but the movement has to take stage elements into accounts, such as diagonals, centres, fronts, placement of lights, etc. Often, show tango routines includes embellishments, acrobatics, and solo moves that would be impractical on a social dance floor.  Stage tango can be partially improvised, but in order for the general choreography to fit the set stage, some parts need to be rehearsed as a set routine.

Stage Tango still has to be led like it is led in all other Tango styles; otherwise the couple is missing the main ingredient of the dance, namely, the typical intimate connection; this connection becomes visible only when the leader and follower enter their roles &nbsp;– whether the show is choreographed or not.

Tango on stage should not be confused with Tango de ''Fantasia'' or tango acrobatico, which is a particular style of tango that is only suitable for stage dancing.<ref>Nicole Nau-Klapwijk: ''Tango Dimensionen'', Kastell Verlag GmbH 1999, {{ISBN|978-3-924592-65-3}}<br />Nicole Nau-Klapwijk: ''Tango, un baile bien porteño'', Editorial Corregidor 2000, {{ISBN|950-05-1311-0}}</ref>

===United Kingdom===
{{unreferenced-section|date=August 2018}}
Argentine tango dancing in the UK began in the early 1990s in response to the hugely popular internationally touring shows "Forever Tango" and "Tango Argentino". Enthusiastic Anglo-Argentine milonguero (dance hall tango dancer) Andrew Potter who had followed "Forever Tango" to London and stayed for its extensive run, got together with some Londoner friends to start the city's first ever tango milonga (tango dance party/hall) in The London Welsh Centre at 157,Grays Inn Road, known as "Tango The Argentine Way" which would pack out every Friday night. From that moment, the tango dances and classes proliferated throughout the Capital and then throughout the rest of the UK.

===USA===
In 1985, the French dance show ''Tango Argentino'' transferred to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in New York City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.totango.net/copes.html |title=Keith Elshaw. 'Juan Carlos Copes' |publisher=Totango.net |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100428061755/http://www.totango.net/copes.html |archivedate=28 April 2010 |deadurl=yes }}</ref> Cast members gave classes to a number of students, including [[Robert Duvall]]. [[Paul Pellicoro]] provided a dance center for the performers to teach new students. At the same time, Danel and Maria Bastone were teaching tango in New York, and Orlando Paiva was offering tango classes in [[Los Angeles]]. For further lessons, Duvall sought out Nestor Ray, a dancer who Duvall had seen perform in the documentary film ''Tango mio''.

In 1986, Nora and Raul Dinzelbacher visited [[San Francisco]], coming from [[La Paz, Entre Ríos]] and [[Buenos Aires]] aboard a cruise ship where they were dancing tango and [[chacarera]] professionally. Al and Barbara Garvey took tango classes from them as well as from Jorge and Rosa Ledesma from [[Quilmes, Buenos Aires]]; all in the style of choreographed show tango. In 1987, the Garveys traveled to Buenos Aires to discover the traditional improvisational social dance style at a large milonga (Centro Akarense) filled with older dancers in [[Villa Urquiza]].<ref>[http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-L/2003/msg01622.html Tango List.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207044345/http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-L/2003/msg01622.html |date=2006-02-07 }} Barbara Garvey. ''Re: [TANGO-L] Going to Bs As (Detecting sham and incompetent Teachers)'' June 27, 2003</ref> Upon returning home to [[Fairfax, California]], the Garveys continued tango lessons and began organizing milongas around the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. They co-founded the Bay Area Argentine Tango Association (BAATA) and published a journal.

In 1986, Brigitta Winkler appeared in her first stage performance, ''Tangoshow'' in [[Montreal]]. Though based in Berlin, Winkler traveled often to teach at tango festivals in North America throughout the following two decades. Winkler was a seminal influence of Daniel Trenner.<ref>{{cite web|author=Nov 6th 2008 1:30PM by Kelly Wilson |url=http://members.aol.com/btango5/bio.htm |title=Brigitta Winkler bio |publisher=Members.aol.com |date=2008-11-06 |accessdate=2010-03-15}}</ref> Montreal's first tango teachers, French-born Lily Palmer and her Argentine friend, Antonio Perea, offered classes in 1987.

The Dinzelbachers settled in San Francisco in 1988, in response to the demand for tango teachers following a visit to San Francisco by the touring production of ''Tango Argentino''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inscenes.com/noraint1.htm |title=George A. Nicol. 'Interview with Nora Dinzelbacher' |publisher=Inscenes.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}</ref> Nora and Raul Dinzelbacher taught a core group of students who would later become teachers themselves, including the Garveys, Polo Talnir and Jorge Allende.

In 1989, the Dinzelbachers were invited to [[Cincinnati]] by Richard Powers, to introduce and teach Argentine tango at a weeklong dance festival. The following year, Powers moved his festival to [[Stanford University]] and asked the Dinzelbachers back. Unfortunately, Raul Dinzelbacher, 40 years old, collapsed and died at the end of the third day of the festival. Nora Dinzelbacher was devastated but threw herself into her work, forming a dance performance troupe and teaching. She asked a student, George Guim, to become her assistant. They taught at a week-long dance festival in [[Port Townsend, Washington]].

Throughout 1990, Luis Bravo's ''Forever Tango'' played in eight West Coast cities, increasing viewer's interest in learning the tango. [[Carlos Gavito]] and his partner [[Marcela Duran]] invented a dramatically different tango embrace in which both dancers leaned forward against each other more than was traditionally accepted. Gavito's ultimate rise to fame came from this starring appearance in ''Forever Tango''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://totango.net/gavitowork.html |first=Keith |last=Elshaw |title=Carlos Gavito 1942&ndash;2005 |publisher=totango.net |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123095227/http://www.totango.net/gavitowork.html |archivedate=2010-01-23 }}</ref>

In 1991, Richard Powers asked Nora Dinzelbacher to help him transform "Stanford Dance Week" into "Stanford Tango Week". The two produced the popular annual festival until the University abruptly cancelled it after its 1997 run. In 1998, with Bob Moretti, a retired USAF Lt. Col. and one of her students, Nora began a new festival in the same vein: "Nora's Tango Week", held in [[Emeryville, California]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.batango.com/spotlight/noras_profile.php |title=BA Tango.

In the first half of 1994, Barbara Garvey's BAATA mailing list grew from 400 to 1,400 dancers. Garvey places the critical mass of the San Francisco Bay Area's tango resurgence at this point. The number of regional milongas went from three per month to 30.<ref>[http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-L/2003/msg02019.html Tango List] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720095543/http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-L/2003/msg02019.html |date=2011-07-20 }} Barbara Garvey.

''Forever Tango'' returned to the United States late in 1994, landing in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]], then San Francisco, where it ran for 92 weeks. From there the show went to New York where it became the longest-running tango production in Broadway history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://starbulletin.com/2000/03/24/features/story1.html |title=Honolulu Star-Bulletin, March 24, 2000.

In June 1995, Janis Kenyon held a tango festival at [[Northwestern University]]. Kenyon had attended Stanford Tango Week in 1993, where she met Juan Carlos Copes and Maria Nieves. The pair were invited to teach at Kenyon's 1995 [[Chicago]] event. The next year, Kenyon moved her festival to [[Columbus, Ohio]], where she featured Osvaldo Zotto. In February 1997, Clay Nelson (a two-time attendee at Stanford Tango Week) organized his first ValenTango festival in [[Portland, Oregon]]; "Tango Fantasy on Miami Beach" was formed by Jorge Nel, Martha Mandel, Lydia Henson and Randy Pittman as [[Florida]]'s first tango festival; and the Portland October Tangofest was launched, again by Clay Nelson. 1999 saw a split in Miami: Nel and Mandel scheduled their "United States Tango Congress" to open a month prior to the Tango Fantasy event.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virtuar.com/tango/articles/2007/oldest_fest.htm |title='Oldest Tango Festival' Randy of Miami, March 23 and 26, 2007 |publisher=Virtuar.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}</ref>

Daniel Trenner has been credited with bringing improvisational social Argentine tango to the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-L/2003/msg00833.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031104063641/http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-L/2003/msg00833.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2003-11-04 |title=Daniel Trenner Tribute |publisher=Pythia.uoregon.edu |date=2003-04-24 |accessdate=2010-03-15 }}</ref> Like the Garveys, he first went to Buenos Aires in 1987, where he went to a milonga in [[Palermo, Buenos Aires|Palermo]] and saw the traditional improvisational style being danced.

and Mingo Pugliese. He made video tapes of the lessons he took and translated the Spanish instruction into English. In the late 1980s, Trenner brought his newfound appreciation of traditional tango back to New York and conducted classes. In 1991, Trenner began working with Rebecca Shulman in performing and teaching tango.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dance-manhattan.com/main_frame.php?cf=./content_teacher_display.php&ins_id=36 |title=Dance Manhattan. 'Rebecca Shulman' |publisher=Dance-manhattan.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}</ref> (Shulman would go on to be a co-founder and director of TangoMujer in New York and Berlin.) In 1995, Trenner taught for ten weeks in [[Colorado]], followed by some 15 of those students accompanying him to Buenos Aires. Out of this experience, "Tango Colorado" was formed by Tom Stermitz and other tango aficionados from [[Denver]], [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] and [[Fort Collins, Colorado|Fort Collins]], and a twice-yearly tango festival was organized in Denver. Trenner had planted the seed and moved on. In this way, Trenner has been called the [[Johnny Appleseed]] of tango.<ref>[http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-L/2003/msg02013.html Tom Stermitz.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720095552/http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-L/2003/msg02013.html |date=2011-07-20 }} ''Re: [TANGO-L]; Revival of Tango in North America / Pellicoro Book'', July 25, 2003]</ref>

In February 2009, the popular ABC series ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 8)|Dancing with the Stars]]'' announced that the Argentine tango would be added to the list of dances for its eighth season, following the initiative by its British parent show ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'' the previous year.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

There are numerous tango festivals in the United States: Seattle Tango Magic, Denver Memorial Day, Portland Valentango in Portland, Oregon, Denver Tango Festival in Denver, Colorado, Boston Tango Festival in Boston.
