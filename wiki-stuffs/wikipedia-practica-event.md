'''Práctica''' is a term for an informal event where [[Argentine tango]] or [[Salsa (dance)|Salsa]] is danced. It is similar to a [[Milonga (event)|Milonga]]. However while a Milonga is rather a formal event where dancers ''socialise'', on a Práctica dancers focus on ''practicing'' the dance.

The music played is similar to the music played on milongas, though the flow of songs is not necessarily broken up by [[cortina (tango)|cortinas]]. Prácticas are often held on a regular basis (usually weekly).
