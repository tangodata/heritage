'''Tango''' is a popular [[partner dance]] and social dance that originated in the 1880s along the [[Río de la Plata|River Plate]] (Río de Plata), the natural border between [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]].

==History==
{{main|History of the tango}}
[[File:How Tango Conquered the World.webm|thumb|The origin and spread of tango]]
Tango is a dance that has influences from [[Culture of Africa|African]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] and [[Culture of Europe|European]] culture.<ref>{{cite BOOK |title=Rise and Fall of the Cosmic Race |last=Miller |first=Marilyn Grace |authorlink= |year=2004 |publisher=University of Texas Press |location= |isbn=0-292-70572-7 |page= |pages=82–89 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fK1xia7EQjkC&pg=PA86&lpg=PA86 |accessdate=2009-03-22 }}</ref> Dances from the [[candombe]] ceremonies of former slave peoples helped shape the modern day tango.

Initially, it was just one of the many dances, but it soon became popular throughout society, as [[theatre]]s and street [[barrel organ]]s spread it from the suburbs to the working-class slums, which were packed with hundreds of thousands of European [[immigrant]]s.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20030611073059/http://frommers.com/destinations/buenosaires/2299028596.html Frommers. Destinations. ''Buenos Aires'']</ref>

Many Buenos Aires city neighbourhoods have their particular tango history like for example [[:es:La Boca|La Boca]], [[:es:San Telmo|San Telmo]] or [[:es:Boedo|Boedo]]. At Boedo Avenue   [[:es:Cátulo Castillo|Cátulo Castillo]], [[:es:Homero Manzi|Homero Manzi]] and other singers and composers used to meet at the [[:es:Café El Japonés|Japanese Cafe]] with the [[:es:Grupo Boedo|Boedo Group]].

In the early years of the 20th century, dancers and orchestras from Buenos Aires travelled to Europe, and the first European tango craze took place in [[Paris]], soon followed by [[London]], [[Berlin]], and other capitals. Towards the end of 1913, it hit [[New York City]] in the U.S., and Finland. In the U.S., around 1911, the word "tango" was often applied to dances in a {{music|time|2|4}} or {{music|time|4|4}} rhythm such as the [[one-step]]. The term was fashionable and did not indicate that tango steps would be used in the dance, although they might be. Tango music was sometimes played but at a rather fast tempo. Instructors of the period would sometimes refer to this as a "North American tango", versus the so-called "Argentine Tango". By 1914, more authentic tango stylings were soon developed,{{Which|date=March 2011}} along with some variations like Albert Newman's "Minuet" tango.

In Argentina, the onset in 1929 of the [[Great Depression]], and restrictions introduced after the overthrow of the [[Hipólito Yrigoyen]] government in 1930, caused tango to decline. Its fortunes were reversed as tango became widely fashionable and a matter of national pride under the government of [[Juan Perón]]. Taquito Militar, by Mariano Mores played a monumental part in the rise of the tango and a major effect on Argentinian culture as a whole. This song was premiered in 1952 during a governmental speech of President Juan D. Perón, which generated a strong political and cultural controversy between different views of the concepts of "cultured" music and "popular" music, as well as the links between both "cultures".

Tango declined again in the 1950s, as a result of economic [[recession|depression]] and the banning of public gatherings by the military [[dictator]]ships; male-only tango practice—the custom at the time—was considered "public gathering". That, indirectly, boosted the popularity of [[rock and roll]] because, unlike tango, it did not require such gatherings.<ref name=TangoHistory>{{cite web|last=Denniston|first=Christine|title=The History of Tango Dance|url=http://www.history-of-tango.com/|accessdate=7 May 2012}}</ref>

In 2009, the tango was added to the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]].<ref>{{cite web|title=UN declares tango part of world cultural heritage|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|date=Sep 30, 2009|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/un-declares-tango-part-of-world-cultural-heritage-20090930-gckv.html|accessdate=Sep 30, 2009}}</ref>

=== Etymology ===
There are two predominant theories regarding the origin of the word "tango." The African culture is credited by some scholars as the creator of this word. It is theorized that the word evolved from the Yoruba word, "shangó," which refers to the Nigerian God of Thunder.<ref name="Poosson 87–99">{{Cite journal|last=Poosson|first=Sylvain|date=Fall 2004|title="Entre Tango y Payada: The Expression of Blacks in 19th Century Argentina."|url=|journal=Confluencia|volume=20|pages=87–99|via=}}</ref> This theory suggests that the word “shangó” was morphed through the dilution of the Nigerian language once it reached South America via slave trade. This theory is paralleled by another theory which believes that “tango” is derived from the Spanish word for drum, “tambor."<ref name="Poosson 87–99"/> This word was then mispronounced by Buenos Aires’ impoverished and uneducated inhabitants to become "tambo," then ultimately resulting in the common "tango." It is also theorized that the word "'tango" is derived from the Portuguese word "tanger," which means "to play a musical instrument." Another Portuguese word, "tangomão," is a possible predecessor of the word "tango." The word is the combination of the verb "tanger" (to touch) with the noun "mão" (hand), and resulted in the verb "to play a musical instrument with one's hands.2"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Megenney|first=William W.|date=2003|title=The River Plate "Tango": Etymology and Origins|jstor=23054732|journal=Afro-Hispanic Review|volume=22|issue=2|pages=39–45}}</ref>

==Styles==
[[Image:TangoPostcard1920.jpg|thumb|250px|Tango postcard, c. 1919]]
[[Image:Tango-Show-Buenos-Aires-01.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Choreographed stage tango in [[Buenos Aires]]]]
[[Image:MundialTango2011-Escenario.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[World tango dance tournament]] in Buenos Aires]]
The tango consists of a variety of styles that developed in different regions and eras of Argentina as well as in other locations around the world. The dance developed in response to many cultural elements, such as the crowding of the venue and even the fashions in clothing. The styles are mostly danced in either open embrace, where [[lead and follow]] have space between their bodies, or [[close embrace]], where the lead and follow connect either chest-to-chest (Argentine tango) or in the upper thigh, hip area (American and International tango).

Different styles of tango are:
* Tango vals
* [[Argentine tango|Tango argentino]]
* [[Tango canyengue]]
* Tango Oriental [[Uruguayan tango]]
* Tango liso
* Tango salon
* Tango orillero
* Tango camacupense (Angola)
* [[Milonguero|Tango milonguero]] (tango apilado)
* Tango nuevo (new tango)
* Contact tango
* Tango Valparaísino (from Valparaíso, Chile).
* Show tango (also known as fantasia)
* [[Tango (ballroom)|Ballroom tango]]
* [[Finnish tango]]

These are danced to several types of music:
* Tango
* Electronic tango-inspired music
* "Alternative tango", i.e. music that is an alternative to tango, or non-tango music employed for use in tango-inspired dance

The milonguero style is characterized by a very close embrace, small steps, and syncopated rhythmic footwork. It is based on the ''petitero'' or ''caquero'' style of the crowded downtown clubs of the 1950s.

In contrast, the tango that originated in the family clubs of the suburban neighborhoods (Villa Urquiza/Devoto/Avellaneda etc.) emphasizes long elegant steps, and complex figures. In this case the embrace may be allowed to open briefly, to permit execution of the complex footwork.

The complex figures of this style became the basis for a theatrical performance style of tango seen in the touring stage shows. For stage purposes, the embrace is often open, and the complex footwork is augmented with gymnastic lifts, kicks, and drops.

A newer style sometimes called ''[[tango nuevo]]'' or "new tango", has been popularized in recent years by a younger generation of dancers. The embrace is often quite open and very elastic, permitting the leader to lead a large variety of very complex figures. This style is often associated with those who enjoy dancing to jazz- and techno-tinged "alternative tango" music, in addition to traditional tango compositions.

===Tango de salon (salon tango)===
{{main|Argentine tango}}

===Tango canyengue===
{{main|Argentine tango}}
''Tango canyengue'' is a rhythmic style of tango that originated in the early 1900s and is still popular today. It is one of the original roots styles of tango and contains all fundamental elements of traditional Tango from the [[Río de la Plata|River Plate]] region (Uruguay and Argentina). In ''tango canyengue'' the dancers share one axis, dance in a closed embrace, and with the legs relaxed and slightly bent. ''Tango canyengue'' uses body dissociation for the leading, walking with firm ground contact, and a permanent combination of on- and off-beat rhythm. Its main characteristics are its musicality and playfulness. Its rhythm is described as "incisive, exciting, provocative".

The complex figures of this style became the basis for a theatrical performance style of Tango seen in the touring stage shows. For stage purposes, the embrace is often very open, and the complex footwork is augmented with gymnastic lifts, kicks, and drops.

===Tango nuevo===
{{Main|Nuevo tango}}

A newer style sometimes called ''[[tango nuevo]]'' or "new tango" was popularized after 1980 by a younger generation of musicians and dancers. [[Ástor Piazzolla]], composer and virtuoso of the [[bandoneón]] (so-called "tango accordion") played a major role in the innovation of traditional tango music.  The embrace is often quite open and very elastic, permitting the leader to initiate a great variety of very complex figures. This style is often associated with those who enjoy dancing to jazz- and techno-tinged, electronic and alternative music inspired in old tangos, in addition to traditional Tango compositions.

''Tango nuevo'' is largely fueled by a fusion between [[tango music]] and [[electronica]] ({{ill|electrotango|es|Tango electrónico}}), though the style can be adapted to traditional tango and even non-tango songs. [[Gotan Project]] released its first tango fusion album in 2000, quickly following with [[La Revancha del Tango]] in 2001. [[Bajofondo Tango Club]], a [[Rioplatense]] music band consisting of seven musicians from Argentina and Uruguay, released their first album in 2002. [[Tanghetto]]'s album [[Emigrante (electrotango)]] appeared in 2003 and was nominated for a Latin Grammy in 2004. These and other electronic tango fusion songs bring an element of revitalization to the tango dance, serving to attract a younger group of dancers.

=== New tango songs ===
In the second half of the 1990s, a movement of new tango songs was born in Buenos Aires. It was mainly influenced by the old orchestra style rather than by Piazzolla's renewal and experiments with electronic music. The novelty lies in the new songs, with today's lyrics and language, which find inspiration in a wide variety of contemporary styles.

In the 2000s, the movement grew with prominent figures such as the Orquesta Típica Fernandez Fierro, whose creator, Julian Peralta,<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1940017-tangos-de-estreno-clasicos-de-las-orquestas-del-futuro|title=Tangos de estreno: clásicos de las orquestas del futuro|access-date=2016-10-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.clarin.com/extrashow/musica/Levantar-tango-siesta_0_743325784.html|title=Levantar al tango de su siesta|last=Cas|first=Andrés|newspaper=Clarin.com|access-date=2016-10-09}}</ref> would later start Astillero and the Orquesta Típica Julián Peralta. Other bands also have become part of the movement such as the Orquesta Rascacielos, Altertango, Ciudad Baigón, as well as singer and songwriters Alfredo "Tape" Rubín,<ref name=":0" /> Victoria di Raimondo,<ref name=":0" /> Juan Serén,<ref name=":0" /> Natalí de Vicenzo<ref name=":0" /> and [[Pacha González]].<ref name=":0" />

===Contact tango===
{{main|Argentine tango|Contact improvisation}}
Contact tango takes inspiration from Argentine tango and [[Contact Improvisation]], both of which are improvised and not choreographed. Contact tango 'blends' the leading and following roles in a similar way to Contact Improvisation, and the dancing partners may frequently change roles during the dance. Contact tango may include the 'floor work' of contact improvisation or other improvised movements which maintain contact between the partners. This differs from Argentine tango where stepping and walking are the dominant motifs. Contact tango is a partner dance but like contact improvisation, it may include more than two dancers on occasion.

===Ballroom tango===
{{main|Ballroom tango}}
[[Image:TangoLesson4.jpg|frame|right|Ballroom tango illustration, 1914]]

Ballroom tango, divided in recent decades into the "International" (Yogita) and "European" styles, has descended from the tango styles that developed when the tango first went abroad to Europe and North America. The dance was simplified, adapted to the preferences of conventional ballroom dancers, and incorporated into the repertoire used in International Ballroom dance competitions. English tango was first codified in October 1922, when it was proposed that it should only be danced to modern tunes, ideally at 30 [[bars per minute]] (i.e. 120 [[beats per minute]] – assuming a {{music|time|4|4}} measure).

Subsequently, the English tango evolved mainly as a highly [[competitive dance]], while the American tango evolved as an unjudged [[social dance]] with an emphasis on [[leading and following]] skills. This has led to some principal distinctions in basic technique and style. Nevertheless, there are quite a few competitions held in the American style, and of course mutual borrowing of technique and dance patterns happens all the time.

Ballroom tangos use different music and styling from the tangos from the River Plata region (Uruguay and Argentina), with more staccato movements and the characteristic ''head snaps''. The head snaps are totally foreign to Argentine and Uruguayan tango, and were introduced in 1934 under the influence of a similar movement in the legs and feet of the tango from the River Plate, and the theatrical movements of the [[pasodoble (dance)|pasodoble]]. This style became very popular in Germany and was soon introduced to England. The movements were very popular with spectators, but not with competition judges.<ref>PJS Richardson, History of English Ballroom Dancing, Herbert Jenkins 1946, pp. 101–102</ref>

===Finnish tango===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
{{main|Finnish tango}}
Tango arrived in Finland in 1913. The tango spread from the dominant urban dance form to become hugely popular across Finland in the 1950s after [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. The melancholy tone of the music reflects the themes of Finnish folk poetry; Finnish tango is almost always in a [[minor key]].

The tango is danced in very close full thigh, pelvis and upper body contact in a wide and strong frame, and features smooth horizontal movements that are very strong and determined. Dancers are very low, allowing long steps without any up and down movement, although rises and falls are optional in some styles. Forward steps land heel first except when descending from a rise, and in backward steps dancers push from the heel. In basic steps, the passing leg moves quickly to rest for a moment close to the grounded leg. Dips and rotations are typical. There is no open position, and typically feet stay close to the floor, except in dips the follower might slightly raise the left leg. Unlike in some Latin American tango styles, in Finnish tango there is no kicking of any kind, and there are no aerials.

The annual Finnish tango festival ''[[Tangomarkkinat]]'' draws over 100,000 tangophiles to the central Finnish town of [[Seinäjoki]]; the town also hosts the Tango Museum..

==Comparison of techniques==
[[File:Demonstratie van de tango 1930.ogv|300px|thumb|A tango demonstration film from 1930]]
[[Argentine]], [[Uruguayan]], and [[Ballroom]] Tango use very different techniques. In Argentine and Uruguayan tango, the body's center moves first, then the feet reach to support it. In ballroom tango, the body is initially set in motion across the floor through the flexing of the lower joints (hip, knee, ankle) while the feet are delayed, then the feet move quickly to catch the body, resulting in snatching or striking action that reflects the staccato nature of this style's preferred music.

In tango, the steps are typically more gliding, but can vary widely in timing, speed, and character, and follow no single specific rhythm. Because the dance is led and followed at the level of individual steps, these variations can occur from one step to the next. This allows the dancers to vary the dance from moment to moment to match the music (which often has both [[legato]] and/or [[staccato]] elements) and their mood.

The Tango's frame, called an ''abrazo'' or "embrace", is not rigid, but flexibly adjusts to different steps, and may vary from being quite close, to offset in a "V" frame, to open. The flexibility is as important as is all movement in dance. The American Ballroom Tango's frame is flexible too, but experienced dancers frequently dance in closed position: higher in the elbows, tone in the arms and constant connection through the body. When dancing socially with a beginners, however, it may be better to use a more open position because the close position is too intimate for them. In American Tango open position may result in open breaks, pivots, and turns which are quite foreign in Argentine tango and International (English) tango.

There is a [[closed position]] as in other types of [[ballroom dance]], but it differs significantly between types of tango. In Tango from the River Plata region, the "close embrace" involves continuous contact at the full upper body, but not the legs. In American Ballroom tango, the "close embrace" involves close contact in the pelvis or upper thighs, but not the upper body. Followers are instructed to thrust their hips forward, but pull their upper body away and shyly look over their left shoulder when they are led into a "corte".

In tango from the River Plate region, the open position, the legs may be intertwined and hooked together, in the style of Pulpo (the Octopus). In Pulpo's style, these hooks are not sharp, but smooth ganchos.

In Tango from the River Plata, Uruguay and Argentina, the ball or toe of the foot may be placed first. Alternatively, the dancer may take the floor with the entire foot in a cat-like manner. In the International style of Tango, "[[Ballroom glossary#Heel lead|heel leads]]" (stepping first onto the heel, then the whole foot) are used for forward steps.

Ballroom tango steps stay close to the floor, while the River Plata Tango (Uruguayan and Argentine) includes moves such as the ''[[boleo]]'' (allowing momentum to carry one's leg into the air) and ''[[gancho (dance move)|gancho]]'' (hooking one's leg around one's partner's leg or body) in which the feet travel off the ground. Both Uruguayan and Argentine tango features other vocabulary foreign to ballroom, such as the ''[[Parada (dance move)|parada]]'' (in which the leader puts his foot against the follower's foot), the ''[[arrastre]]'' (in which the leader appears to drag or be dragged by the follower's foot), and several kinds of ''[[sacada (tango)|sacada]]'' (in which the leader displaces the follower's leg by stepping into her space).

==Tango influence==

[[Image:LakeMerrit OutdoorMilonga.jpg|thumb|Casual Argentine tango dancing outdoors]]

Music and dance elements of tango are popular in activities related to [[gymnastics]], [[figure skating]], [[synchronized swimming]], etc., because of its dramatic feeling and its cultural associations with romance.

For the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]] in Argentina, [[Adidas]] designed a ball and named it Tango, likely a tribute to the host country of the event.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerballworld.com/TangoRiver.htm|title=Tango 1978|website=www.soccerballworld.com}}</ref> This design was also used in [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] in Spain as ''Tango Málaga'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerballworld.com/TangoEspana.htm|title=Tango 1982|website=www.soccerballworld.com}}</ref> and in 1984 and 1988 [[UEFA European Football Championship]]s in France and West Germany.

==Tango in society==

Tango appears in different aspects of society: Regular [[milonga (place)|milonga]]s and special festivals. A very famous festival is the Tango Buenos Aires Festival y Mundial in [[Buenos Aires]]. On a regional level there are also many festivals inside and outside of [[Argentina]]. One local festival outside Argentina is [[Buenos Aires in the Southern Highlands]] in Australia.

==Health benefits==
It has been suggested that tango makes people feel more relaxed, sexier, and less depressed, and increases testosterone levels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/201008/mind-your-body-dance-yourself-happy|title=Mind Your Body: Dance Yourself Happy|work=Psychology Today|accessdate=24 February 2016}}</ref>

Dance targets six main areas considered to be important for high quality of life and successful aging:
# physical exercise
# social satisfaction
# spirituality and mindfulness
# cognition
# meaningfulness
# emotional and educational health

While all types of dance confers some types of benefits, Argentine tango dancing, in particular, has documented evidence that these areas are improved in both healthy and disabled populations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.todotango.com/english/history/chronicle/450/The-benefits-of-Argentine-tango-dancing/|title=The benefits of Argentine tango dancing|accessdate=9 August 2016}}</ref>

[[Tangolates]] is an exercise method that combines the core stability of [[Pilates]] with the concentration, coordination and fluid movement of tango, designed in 2004 by Tamara Di Tella. Utilizing a partner-method and incorporating the aerobic or cardio element of music, it started as a rehabilitation technique for patients with severe dysfunctions of the [[nervous system]].
