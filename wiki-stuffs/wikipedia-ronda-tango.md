'''Ronda''' (Spanish "''la ronda''" for "''the ring''" or "''the round''") refers to the [[line of dance]] in [[Argentine Tango]]. Similar to [[ballroom dancing]] the traditional ronda requires the dance couples to move counter clockwise around the room.<ref>Ed Loomis, A Guide to Tango Terminology, http://www.tejastango.com/terminology.html#R</ref> This enables many couples to share the floor in [[social dance]] situations.

The ronda consists of imagined ''concentric lanes'' on the dance floor. (A medium floor has usually of 2-3 of these lanes.) In each lane couples are dancing only behind/in front of each other, never next to each other.
The couples move with roughly the same pace, leaving a similar distance between each other.<ref>Ramu Pyreddy, Argentine Tango Etiquette, http://www.umich.edu/~umtango/etiquette.html</ref> When the floor is particularly crowded the couples move effectively with each step into the space where the couple in front of them just had been.

The ronda enables the dancers to move in a predictable way. Knowing in roughly what direction the other people will move, helps the couples to dance calmer and more focused. With this they enjoy the dance better.<ref>M. Chisholm, More than 2 to tango: the joy of being part of the milonga, http://tangointhespring.org.au/2012/10/more-than-2-to-tango/</ref>
