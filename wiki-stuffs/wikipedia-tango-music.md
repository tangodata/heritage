'''Tango''' is a style of music in [[Time signature|{{music|time|2|4}} or {{music|time|4|4}}]] time that originated among European immigrant populations of [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]] (collectively, the "[[Rioplatense Spanish|Rioplatenses]]").<ref name=UNESCO>{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hy8EQ1hEp3BVG-vnlwrClzXfpA7A |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227234508/http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hy8EQ1hEp3BVG-vnlwrClzXfpA7A|archivedate=27 February 2014|deadurl=yes|title=Argentina, Uruguay bury hatchet to snatch tango honor |last=Termine |first=Laura |date=September 30, 2009 |accessdate=April 2, 2010 |location=Buenos Aires }}</ref> It is traditionally played on a solo guitar, guitar duo, or an ensemble, known as the ''[[orquesta típica]]'', which includes at least two [[violin]]s, [[flute]], [[piano]], [[double bass]], and at least two [[bandoneón]]s. Sometimes guitars and a clarinet join the ensemble. Tango may be purely instrumental or may include a vocalist. Tango music and [[tango (dance)|dance]] have become popular throughout the world.

== Origins ==
[[Image:Early-bandonion.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Early bandoneón, constructed ca. 1905]]

Even though present forms developed in Argentina and Uruguay from the mid 19th century, there are records of 19th and early 20th century Tango styles in [[Cuba]] and Spain,<ref name=OrtizOrigen>José Luis Ortiz Nuevo ''El origen del tango americano''  Madrid and La Habana 1849</ref> while there is a flamenco [[Tango (flamenco)|Tangos]] dance that may share a common ancestor in a minuet-style European dance.<ref name=DennistonCouple>[http://www.history-of-tango.com/couple-dancing.html Christine Denniston. ''Couple Dancing and the Beginning of Tango'' 2003]</ref> All sources stress the influence of the African communities and their rhythms, while the instruments and techniques brought in by European immigrants in the 20th century played a major role in its final definition, relating it to the [[Salon music]] styles to which Tango would contribute back at a later stage.

[[Angel Villoldo]]'s 1903 tango [[El Choclo]] was first recorded no later than 1906 in Philadelphia.<ref name="DAHR-b3624">{{cite web|title=Victor matrix B-3624.

Early tango was played by immigrants in [[Buenos Aires]] then later in [[Montevideo]].<ref>Norese, María Rosalía: ''Contextualization and analysis of tango.

It took time to move into wider circles: in the early 20th century it was the favorite music of thugs and [[gangsters]] who visited the [[brothels]],<ref>[http://www.ellitoral.com/index.php/id_um/99627-el-tango-y-las-putas Tango and whores] {{es icon}}</ref> in a city with 100,000 more men than women (in 1914). The complex dances that arose from such rich music reflects how the men would practice the dance in groups, demonstrating male sexuality and causing a blending of emotion and aggressiveness. The music was played on portable instruments: [[flute]], [[guitar]] and [[violin]] trios, with [[bandoneón]] arriving at the end of the 19th century. The ''[[organito]]'', a portable player-organ, broadened the popularity of certain songs. [[Eduardo Arolas]] was the major instrument of the bandoneón's popularization, with [[Vicente Greco]] soon standardizing the tango sextet as consisting of [[piano]], [[double bass]], two [[violins]] and two bandoneóns.

Like many forms of popular music, tango was associated with the underclass, and attempts were made to restrict its influence{{By whom|date=October 2014}}. In spite of the scorn, some, like writer [[Ricardo Güiraldes]], were fans. Güiraldes played a part in the international popularization of tango, which had conquered the world by the end of World War I, and wrote a poem ("Tango") which describes the music as the "all-absorbing love of a tyrant, jealously guarding his dominion, over women who have surrendered submissively, like obedient beasts".<ref name=DennistonCouple/>

One song that would become the most widely known of all tango melodies<ref>{{cite book|last=McLean |first=Michael |title=Care to Tango?, Book 2 |isbn=0-7390-5100-8}}</ref> also dates from this time. The first two sections of ''[[La Cumparsita]]'' were composed as a march instrumental in 1916 by teen-aged [[Gerardo Matos Rodríguez]] of Uruguay.<ref>[http://totango.net/cumpar.html ToTANGO.

== Argentine roots of Tango ==

Besides the global influences mentioned above, early Tango was locally influenced by [[Payada]], the [[Milonga (music)|Milonga]] from Argentine and Uruguay [[Pampas]], and Uruguayan [[Candombe]]. In Argentina there was Milonga "from the country" since the mid eighteenth century. The first "payador" remembered is [[Santos Vega]]. The origins of Milonga seem to be in the Pampa with strong African influences, especially though the local Candombe (which would be related to its contemporary Candombe in Buenos Aires and Montevideo). It is believed that this candombe existed and was practised in Argentina since the first slaves were brought into the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.revistaquilombo.com.ar/documentos/frigeriocandombeargentino.pdf|title=Revista Quilombo – Noticias, columnas, articulos y opiniones.|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310062053/http://www.revistaquilombo.com.ar/documentos/frigeriocandombeargentino.pdf|archivedate=10 March 2012|df=}}</ref>

Although the word "tango" to describe a music/dance style had been printed as early as 1823 in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]], the first Argentinian written reference is from an 1866 newspaper, that quotes the song "La Coqueta" (an [[Argentine tango]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hlmtango.com/notas/historia-del-tango/el-nacimiento-del-tango/|title=Notas  - Historia del Tango - El nacimiento del Tango -  hlm!.Tango - Hágase la música - hagaselamusica.com|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref> In 1876 a tango-candombe called "El Merenguengué"<ref>[http://www.denorteasur.com/asp/articulo.asp?numero=241&id=766 Tango-candombe afroargentino "El Merenguengué".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321094524/http://www.denorteasur.com/asp/articulo.asp?numero=241&id=766 |date=2012-03-21 }}{{Verify source|date=November 2016}}<!--All archives for this URL display a different title: "Los comienzos del tango".--></ref><ref>Jorge Gutman <s>op. cit.</s>{{Full citation needed|date=November 2016}}<!--There is nothing by anyone named Gutman cited elsewhere in this article.--></ref> became very popular, after its success in the Afro-Argentines carnival held in February of that year. It is played with harp, violin and flute in addition to the Afro-Argentine Candombe drums ("Llamador" and "Repicador"). This has been seriously considered as one of the strong points of departure for the birth and development of Tango.<ref>[http://estatico.buenosaires.gov.ar/areas/cultura/museos/dg_museos/pdf/gardel/historianegra.pdf Museum House of Carlos Gardel “The Black history of Tango”.]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706083507/http://estatico.buenosaires.gov.ar/areas/cultura/museos/dg_museos/pdf/gardel/historianegra.pdf |date=2011-07-06 }}</ref>

The first  "group" of tango, was composed of two [[Afro-Argentine]]s, "the black" [[Casimiro Alcorta]] (violin)  and "the mulatto" Sinforoso (clarinet).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rincondeltango.com/ht/HTLosPrimitivosC.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060712034120/http://www.rincondeltango.com/ht/HTLosPrimitivosC.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=12 July 2006|title="Historia del tango-Los primitivos conjuntos" por Tesy Cariaga – Buenos Aires – Argentina.- .: Rincón del Tango :.|first=|last=www.RrinconDelTango.com|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref> They did small concerts in Buenos Aires since the early 1870s until the early 1890s.

The first recorded musical score (though no author) is "La Canguela" (1889) and is in the Museum of the City Score Rosario. On the other hand, the first copyrighted tango score is "El entrerriano", released in 1896 and printed in 1898 – by [[Rosendo Mendizabal]], an Afro-Argentine. As for the transition between the old "Tango criollo" (Milonga from the Pampas, evolved with touches of Afro-Argentine Candombe, and some of [[habanera (music)|Habanera)]], and the Tango of the Old Guard, there are the next songs: [[Ángel Villoldo]] ("[[El choclo]]", 1903) ("El Pimpolla", 1904), ("La Vida del Carretero", 1905) y ("El Negro Alegre", 1907), de [[Gabino Ezeiza]] ("El Tango Patagones", 1905), y de [[Higinio Cazón]] ("El Taita", 1905).

== 1920s and 1930s, Carlos Gardel ==
[[Image:Gardel.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Carlos Gardel]], perpetual symbol of tango]]
[[File:Por una cabeza carlos gardel.ogg|right|thumb|"Por Una Cabeza" (1935) by Carlos Gardel and Alfredo Le Pera. Sung by Carlos Gardel.]]
Tango soon began to gain popularity in Europe, beginning in France. Superstar [[Carlos Gardel]] soon became a [[sex symbol]] who brought tango to new audiences, especially in the United States, due to his sensual depictions of the dance on film. In the 1920s, tango moved out of the lower-class brothels and became a more respectable form of music and dance. Bandleaders like [[Roberto Firpo]] and [[Francisco Canaro]] dropped the flute and added a [[double bass]] in its place. Lyrics were still typically macho, blaming women for countless heartaches, and the dance moves were still sexual and aggressive.

[[Carlos Gardel]] became especially associated with the transition from a lower-class "gangster" music to a respectable middle-class dance. He helped develop [[tango-canción]] in the 1920s and became one of the most popular tango artists of all time. He was also one of the precursors of the '''Golden Age of tango'''.

Gardel's death was followed by a division into movements within tango. Evolutionists like [[Aníbal Troilo]] and [[Carlos di Sarli]] were opposed to traditionalists like [[Rodolfo Biagi]] and [[Juan d'Arienzo]].

== Golden Age ==

The "Golden Age" of tango music and dance is generally agreed to have been the period from about 1935 to 1952, roughly contemporaneous with the [[big band]] era in the United States. Tango was performed by [[Orquesta típica|orquestas típicas]], bands often including over a dozen performers.

Some of the many popular and influential orchestras included the orchestras of [[Mariano Mores]], [[Juan d'Arienzo]], [[Francisco Canaro]], and [[Aníbal Troilo]]. D'Arienzo was called the "Rey del compás" or "King of the beat" for the insistent, driving rhythm which can be heard on many of his recordings. "El flete" is an excellent example of D'Arienzo's approach. Canaro's early milongas are generally the slowest and easiest to dance to; and for that reason, they are the most frequently played at tango dances ([[Milonga (place)|milongas]]); "Milonga Sentimental" is a classic example.

Beginning in the Golden Age and continuing afterwards, the orchestras of [[Osvaldo Pugliese]] and [[Carlos di Sarli]] made many recordings. Di Sarli had a lush, grandiose sound, and emphasized strings and piano over the bandoneón, which is heard in "A la gran muñeca" and "[[Bahía Blanca]]" (the name of his home town).

Pugliese's first recordings were not too different from those of other dance orchestras, but he developed a complex, rich, and sometimes discordant sound, which is heard in his signature pieces, "Gallo ciego", "Emancipación", and "La yumba". Pugliese's later music was played for an audience and not intended for dancing, although it is often used for stage choreography for its dramatic potential, and sometimes played late at night at milongas.

Eventually tango transcended its Latin boundaries, as European bands adopted it into their dance repertoires<sup>[23–27]</sup>. Non-traditional instruments were often added, such as accordion (in place of bandoneon), saxophone, clarinet, ukulele, mandolin, electric organ, etc., as well as lyrics in non-Spanish languages. European tango became a mainstream worldwide dance and popular music style, alongside with foxtrot, slow waltz, and rumba. It somewhat diverged from its Argentinian origin and developed characteristic European styles. Famous European band leaders who adopted tango included, to name a few, {{ill|Otto Dobrindt|de}}, [[Marek Weber]], [[Oskar Joost]], {{ill|Barnabas von Geczy|de}}, Jose Lucchesi, {{ill|Kurt Widmann|de|Kurt Widmann (Musiker)}}, {{ill|Adalbert Lutter|de}}, [[Paul Godwin]], [[Alexander Tsfasman]], as well as famous singers [[Leo Monosson]], [[Zarah Leander]], [[Rudi Schuricke]], [[Tino Rossi]], {{ill|Janus Poplawski|pl|Janusz Popławski (muzyk)}}, [[Mieczysław Fogg]], [[Pyotr Leshchenko]], and others. The popularity of European tango precipitously declined with the advent of rock-n-roll in the 50s–60s.<ref>Jürgen Wölfer Jazz in Deutschland – Das Lexikon.

== Tango nuevo ==
The later age of tango has been dominated by [[Ástor Piazzolla]], whose ''[[Adios Nonino|Adiós nonino]]'' became the most influential work of tango music since Carlos Gardel's ''[[El día que me quieras (song)|El día que me quieras]]'' was released in 1935. During the 1950s, Piazzolla consciously tried to create a more academic form with new sounds breaking the classic forms of tango, drawing the derision of purists and old-time performers. The 1970s saw Buenos Aires developing a fusion of [[jazz]] and tango. [[Litto Nebbia]] and Siglo XX were especially popular within this movement. In the 1970s and 1980s, the vocal octet [[Buenos Aires 8]] recorded classic tangos in elaborate arrangements, with complex harmonies and jazz influence, and also recorded an album with compositions by Piazzolla.

The so-called post-Piazzolla generation (1980–) includes musicians such as [[Dino Saluzzi]], [[Rodolfo Mederos]], Gustavo Beytelmann and Juan Jose Mosalini. Piazzolla and his followers developed ''[[nuevo tango]]'', a musical genre that incorporated jazz and classical influences into a more experimental style.

In the late 1990s, composer and pianist [[Fernando Otero]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nonesuch.com/artists/fernando-otero|title=About Fernando Otero|work=[[Nonesuch Records]]|author=Michael Hill|accessdate=2013-05-13}}</ref> continued to add elements to the innovation process which had started decades ago, expanding the orchestration and form while including improvisation and atonal aspects in his work.

== Neotango ==

Tango development did not stop with [[tango nuevo]]. 21st-century tango is referred to as [[neotango]]. These recent trends can be described as "electro tango" or "tango fusion", where the electronic influences range from subtle to dominant.

[[Tanghetto]] and [[Carlos Libedinsky]] are good examples of the subtle use of electronic elements. The music still has its tango feeling, the complex rhythmic and melodious entanglement that makes tango so unique. [[Gotan Project]] is a group that formed in 1999 in Paris, consisting of musicians Philippe Cohen Solal, [[Eduardo Makaroff]] and Christoph H Muller. Their releases include ''Vuelvo al Sur/El capitalismo foráneo'' (2000), ''[[La Revancha del Tango]]'' (2001), ''[[Inspiración Espiración]]'' (2004), and ''[[Lunático]]'' (2006). Their sound features electronic elements like samples, beats and sounds on top of a tango groove. Some dancers enjoy dancing to this music, although many traditional dancers regard it as a definite break in style and tradition.

[[Bajofondo Tango Club]] is another example of electro-tango. Further examples can be found on the [[CD]]s ''Tango?'', [[Hybrid Tango]], [[Tangophobia Vol. 1]], ''Tango Crash'' (with a major [[jazz]] influence), ''Latin Tango'' by Rodrigo Favela (featuring classic and modern elements), ''NuTango''. ''Tango Fusion Club Vol. 1'' by the creator of the milonga called "Tango Fusion Club" in [[Munich]], Germany, ''Felino'' by the Norwegian group [[Electrocutango]] and "Electronic Tango", a compilation CD. In 2004, the music label World Music Network released a collection under the title ''The Rough Guide to Tango Nuevo''.

== New tango songs ==
In the second half of the nineteen-nineties, a new movement of tango composers and tango orchestras playing new songs was born in Buenos Aires. It was mainly influenced by the old orchestra style rather than by Piazzolla’s renewal and experiments with electronic music. The novelty lies in the new songs, with today’s lyrics and language, which find inspiration in a wide variety of contemporary styles.

Over the two first decades of this century, the movement has grown with the creation of countless bands playing new tangos. The most prominent figures leading this phenomenon have been the Orquesta Típica Fernandez Fierro, whose creator, Julian Peralta,<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1399835-julian-peralta-la-seleccion-de-los-tangos-nuevos|title=Julián Peralta: La selección de los tangos nuevos|access-date=2016-10-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.clarin.com/extrashow/musica/Levantar-tango-siesta_0_743325784.html|title=Levantar al tango de su siesta|last=Cas|first=Andrés|newspaper=Clarin.com|access-date=2016-10-09}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1940017-tangos-de-estreno-clasicos-de-las-orquestas-del-futuro|title=Tangos de estreno: clásicos de las orquestas del futuro|access-date=2016-10-09}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=http://tiempoar.com.ar/articulo/view/60510/pensamos-al-tango-como-una-ma-sica-popular|title="Pensamos al tango como una música popular" – tiempoar.com.ar|last=tiempoar.com.ar|newspaper=tiempoar.com.ar|access-date=2016-10-09}}</ref> would later start Astillero and the Orquesta Típica Julián Peralta.

== Musical impact and classical interpreters ==

Although tango music was strictly circumscribed to the tango interpreters it was the classically trained Argentinian pianist Arminda Canteros (1911–2002) who used to play tangos to satisfy the requests of her father who could not understand [[Classical music]]. She developed her own style and had a weekly program of tango music for a radio station in [[Rosario]], [[Argentina]] in the 1930s and 1940s. Since tango playing was considered the epitome of [[machismo]], she had to take the masculine pseudonym, "Juancho" for the broadcasts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZijnqLrBSO0|title=Arminda Canteros, pianist, plays Invierno Porteño by Astor Piazzolla|first=|last=JohnDavidChapman|date=8 August 2011|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2016|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eltangoysusinvitados.com/2009/08/arminda-canteros-biografia.html|title=El Tango y sus invitados: Arminda Canteros|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref>

Ms. Canteros settled in [[New York City]] in 1970 where she recorded later in 1989 her CD "Tangos" when she was 78 years old.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eltangoysusinvitados.com/2009/08/arminda-canteros-tangossolos-de-piano.html|title=El Tango y sus invitados: Arminda Canteros – Tangos(Solos de piano)-1989|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref>
Following Ms. Cantero’s example, another Argentinian female pianist brought tango music to the concert halls: [[Cecilia Pillado]] played a complete tango recital at the [[Berliner Philharmonie]] in 1997 and recorded that program for her CD “Cexilia’s Tangos”.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tangomalambo.com/en/cexilias-tangos.html|title=Tango Malambo – Cecilia Pillado´s Label|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817022509/http://www.tangomalambo.com/en/cexilias-tangos.html|archivedate=17 August 2016|df=}}</ref>

Since then tango has become part of the repertoire for great classical musicians like the baritone [[Jorge Chaminé]] with his ''Tangos'' recording with [[bandoneón]]ist [[Olivier Manoury]]. Also [[al Tango]], [[Yo-Yo Ma]], [[Martha Argerich]], [[Daniel Barenboim]], [[Gidon Kremer]], [[Plácido Domingo]] and [[Marcelo Alvarez]] have performed and recorded Tangos.

Some classical composers have written tangos, such as [[Isaac Albéniz]] in ''España'' (1890), [[Erik Satie]] in ''Le Tango perpétuel'' (1914), [[Igor Stravinsky]] in ''[[Histoire du Soldat]]'' (1918). Nikolai Myaskovsky composed an Argentinian Death Tango for a poem War and Peace. [[Kurt Weill]] continued this style in ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' (1928) (Die Dreigroschenoper), e.g. composed a song called 'Tango Ballade' or 'Zuhälterballade', a fateful song about underworld life (a symphonic version in suite Kleine Dreigroschenmusik commissioned by [[Otto Klemperer]]); a bit latter he composed another evergreen, 'Youkali' (Tango-Habanera) on French lyrics. Also noteworthy was the accordionist [[John Serry Sr.]] who composed ''Tango of Love'' & ''Petite Tango'' for accordion quartet (1955).<ref>Library of Congress- Copyright Office, ''Tango of Love'', ''Petite Tango''. Copyright – Alpha Music Co., New York, NY. Composer: John Serry Sr. 1955</ref>  The list of composers who wrote inspired by tango music also includes [[John Cage]] in ''Perpetual Tango'' (1984), [[John Harbison]] in "Tango Seen from Ground Level" (1991), and [[Milton Babbitt]] in "It Takes Twelve to Tango" (1984). The influence of [[Piazzolla]] has fallen on a number of contemporary composers. The "Tango Mortale" in ''Arcadiana'' by [[Thomas Adès]] is an example.

Many popular songs in the United States have borrowed melodies from tango: the earliest published tango, ''El Choclo'', lent its melody to the fifties hit ''[[Kiss of Fire]]''. Similarly ''Adiós Muchachos'' became ''[[I Get Ideas]]'', and ''Strange Sensation'' was based on ''[[La Cumparsita]]''.

Showing tango music's continued popularity, multiple international radio stations broadcast non-stop tango music today.<ref>[http://argentinetangoradio.com Argentine Tango Radio]</ref>
