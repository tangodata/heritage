      <br>
      <div class="Text"><b>Alberto Paz</b> and <b>Valorie Hart</b>
combine their passion for and profound understanding of the tango with
their unparalleled skill as teachers, their maturity as dancers, and
their full time dedication and generosity to technical excellence
regardless of favorite styles and musical preferences.<br>
      <br>
Their workshops involve moderate hard work. People are encouraged not
to shy away from any workshop on account of a personal or someone
else&#8217;s perception of your level of expertise. The experience of being
in the hands of masters is complete and inspiring and worth everything
you put into it. <br>
      <br>
The method they employ fosters progressive equalization in a genuinely
caring environment intended to make the dancer feel welcome,
relaxed&nbsp; and even smile, but also challenge him/her to build
confidence in his/her ability to learn and progress, in each and every
workshop.<br>
      <br>
Paz and Hart are the authors of the best seller book GOTTA TANGO, an
important&nbsp; resource that offers a logical and structured approach

Dear Alberto &amp; Valorie,<br>
I began Argentine Tango lessons at the Sondra Cameron Studio in New
York City 21 months ago, and I am among the many whose life has been
revolutionized by this art.&nbsp; Two weeks ago I purchased your book
"Gotta Tango", and you have opened
even more enjoyment and fascination.<br>
In particular I like your website of Lyrics and English translation,
with the classic recordings accessible with Quicktime.&nbsp; Wonderful.
All the best.<br>
      <br>
JAMES<br>
Hi Alberto and Valorie. I am now well into chapter three of the book
and in combination with the video, am now much better informed about
the Tango. I now have a clearer picture and have learned more in the
past four weeks than I ever did in the past two years of part-time
workshops etc. I am so pleased with the results that I am recommending
Gotta Tango to all my friends here in,Ireland. Thank you both for
putting me right on track. I look forward to every milonga event with
great gusto now. Best wishes and happy dancing.<br>
      <br>
      <b>GEORGIO</b><br>
(Q) I haven't bought your book but reading the reviews of your book
you sent, I've become curious: <br>
(A) Thank you very much for your interest. <br>
      <br>
(Q) Did you find that the lead-follow paradigm was limiting in some
way that was reflected in the students? <br>
(A) Not only limiting but conveying the mistaken belief that tango
can be learned as if it was the eleventh dance of the ballroom
circuit.
The organic essence of the Argentine tango is its improvisational
nature. It can't be a lead and follow dance by virtue of the
embrace where there is only one engine that moves the couple at once.
We have to emphasize here that we're talking about improvisation,
moving on the spur of the movement for whatever reasons dictated by
the music, the mood and the conditions of the dance floor.
When the man moves, the woman's upper body in his embrace comes with
him NOW, not after she's figured out the 'lead' and decided on what
to do to how 'follow.'
In this authentic and traditional form of the Argentine tango, the
woman is taught to carry her weight always on her forward leg, the
one closer to the man at the beginning of every step. A 'follower' in
turn carries her weight on her rear leg so she can have leverage to
follow, i.e to energize her free leg to move (have you seen how many
good 'followers' stick out their butts for that reason?). <br>
      <br>
(Q) Like anything else, lead-follow is a label and it can mean
different things to different people and so I know how it COULD be
limiting but at the same time I haven't seen it limit people in that
way. <br>
(A) Yes labels don't really mean anything. When people think that
'marcando' is the same as leading, they don't understand the dynamics
of the embrace, the use of the points of contact, and the set of
techniques available to improvise with anybody, anywhere.
They're learning sets of steps (basic, fancy, tricky, cool, etc.)
that leads to obsession with taking classes and more classes from
a wide variety of step dispensers. In many cases the steps are used
to dance to every possible kind of music but tango.
Learning how to dance under a properly structured program sends
people to the dance floor in a reasonable amount of time, and classes
are no longer the obsession but the dance it is (think Buenos Aires
if you can, where the great majority of regulars at the milongas have
not taken a class in years). <br>
      <br>
(Q) I guess what I'm saying is that I use the lead-follow paradigm to
communicate the same principles you communicate through your
partnership paradigm and thus what I'm asking would be: what made you
feel that the partnership paradigm is MORE useful? <br>
(A) Our own personal experience and results. Over the last ten years
we have sent to the dance floor,
- Men who know how to embrace for a purpose rather than for
fads.
- Who know the trajectories available on a dance floor, and are
capable of protecting their partners while dancing around the floor
using the code to make their partners dance around them.
- Men, who after learning how to dance enjoy their time dancing
instead of taking class after class ad infinitum. But when they do
take a class, they are fully trained to know how to take a class.
- Women who understand the concept of always dancing with the axis
closer to the man, so their bodies always have a 360 degrees range
for rotation if needed.
- Women who feel comfortable in their bodies and allow their bodies
to go along in the embrace, with the support leg firmly on axis and
the free leg free to decorate if they wish to do so while it travels
to receive the weight change at the end of the 'step.' <br>
      <br>
      <b>TERRY</b>
- Compact, informative and fun, this integrated digital and print
textbook should be "required reading" for all students of Argentine
Tango. It is not another coffee-table Tango book. Myth-busters Paz and
Hart concentrate the founding history, culture and traditions of the
Tango in the initial chapters. They follow this with clear and concise
explanations of all the core movements; the text integrates seamlessly
with the DVD chapters. All material is representative of the essential
elements of Tango covered in some of the most expensive and exclusive
classes around the world. Unlike many other "master" teachers, this
American-Argentine duo clarifies every term and movement with precision
and elegance. Both novice and expert have much to learn from "Gotta
Tango". <b><br>
      <br>
      </b><span style="font-weight: bold;">DUBRAVKO</span>
- After
more than three years of being involved in tango and after having
been around Valorie and Alberto many times, both in classes, lessons,
and workshops as well as at a dinner table or just standing at the edge
of dance floor BS-ing, or singing along with a tango karaoke, I was
naturally drawn to their book Gotta Tango. <br>
      <br>
And
I did what I was not supposed to do (they say to use the DVD as an
accompaniment to the book - not alone or the other way around) - I put
the DVD in the player and started going through the chapters. Good
stuff, I said. But, something was missing. Then I said, well, perhaps I
should follow the advice and turn to the book. So, this morning, I got
up early, carefully prepared myself, made a good cup of coffee, lit
incense, candles burning (it was still dark outside when I started) and
set out to read the book on this perfect, rainy Thanksgiving morning.
Well, let me tell you. I
just finished the introduction and it transported me back
into the magic of the magic called tango. <br>
      <br>
Now I can not wait
to continue reading; although, I know that this is the book you do not
read and read and read - you study, study, and study it. I have taken
enough classes and lessons with Alberto and Valorie and plan to take
more to know the depth and the
breath of their knowledge as well as their ability and willingness to
transfer that knowledge to those who really want to learn. And, as they
say in the book (and that applies to their workshops and classes as
well), <br>
      <br>
"We
assume you are an adult, and we'll treat you that way. If you have come
to disagree with us, you will do so. If you come with openness and
listen to what we say, you will learn how to dance using the
fundamentals of the Argentine tango."<br>
      <br>
If
I appear to endorse "Gotta Tango," so be it, I plead guilty! And why
not? If the thing is real and good, I will say so. At this point in my
life I have learned, I hope, that every medal has (at least) two sides
and I make the decision to which side to pay attention and which one(s)
to ignore. I choose positive.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>

- I attended a book signing
Sunday evening for Valorie Hart and Alberto Paz' new book "Gotta
Tango" at the Garden District home of Barbara and Edwin Beckman in New
Orleans. The hardy souls who braved the worst, wettest&nbsp;weather we
have seen in New Orleans in quite a while were rewarded with readings
by the authors,
live tango music, played in piano rendition by Amassa
Miller, the well known New Orleans musician, and a warm and friendly
gathering of tango dancers and
supporters from New Orleans and beyond.<br>
      <br>
Alberto read first from the foreword of the book, written by
Acho Manzi, describing the historical circumstances
that contributed to the establishment of tango in the 20th
century. Notably, he writes, "Credit for this (e.g. global explosion)
is often given to the most glamorous catalysts in the form of tango
shows and tango movies. But a more grassroots influence exists in the
form of a handful of protagonists who preserve and foster the tango for
the love and respect of it. Two such persons come in the names of
Alberto Paz..and Valorie Hart... Through their exploration, Alberto and
Valorie have made the dance form something teachable by expanding on
old ideas and codes that permeated the world of tango when they and
others found it languishing for lack of interest and understanding." <br>
      <br>
Valorie then read from the acknowledgements..." What Katrina
did to New Orleans and our four months in exile played a fundamental
role in the way this book went through an epiphany of sorts...What a
difference the year after Katrina made in our lives. We like to think
that it happened to us for a reason - that after our four month tour,
teaching with a passion and inspiration that we had not
experienced before, we wrote a better book...." and from the
introduction, "There is something so human about the Argentine tango
that grabs a primal instinct for human connection, to hold and to be
held. All over the world, people are dancing this dance of the people
of Buenos Aires with a passion that has been compared to a healthy
addiction." <br>
      <br>
In the blackened, wind swept&nbsp;evening, last&nbsp;night's
attendees were held, and connected&nbsp;in a circle of light, with the
love, and lovers&nbsp;of tango at its center. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">RICHARD and
DOROTHY</span>
- I've been perusing "Gotta Tango" and reading little excerpts from
various places. It is a wonderful book filled with lots of wonderful
little tips. Thank you and Valorie for all the love and work you put
into this great book.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">JOE</span>
- Got a question on the steps of the "Simple Salida". Alberto, starts
and counts the first lateral step as ONE. After the resolution, he
steps back with his right and repeats the salida. Shouldn't that back
step be counted as ONE or EIGHT to complete the 8 count/measure of the
pattern? Or just pretend that back step is a fake step.<br>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <i><span style="font-weight: bold;">ANSWER</span> - The pattern
you mention consists of two elements, the actual
salida and the resolution, each consisting of four steps, and which
could executed independently from each other. For the man, the simple
salida
starts with the opening to the man's left (1) and ends at the cruzada
position (4).<br>
The resolution starts with a forward step with the left leg (1) and
ends with a back diagonal with the right (4).<br>
When executed together, the resulting sequence fits on an 8 count
measure, so the fist step may be counted as ONE, and the step counts as
EIGHT.<br>
The best way to understand the structure is to remember that the salida
starts with the first step of La base, and the resolution ends with the
last step of La base. Counting becomes irrelevant and allows you to
phrase the the music as you wish.</i> <br>

- Congratulations to the release of your book and thank you for sending
it right away. So far I only had time to take a peak at your book and
DVD. It looks excellent. The lessons are clear and well coordinated
with the great looking DVD. Most anyone can grasp the basics of the
dance from your thoughtfully put together history of tango and
instructions. For those who have been dancing a while, it can serve as
a valuable tool to look at from time to time and 'clean' up some
acquired habits. <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">CHAS</span>
- I just checked out the new book by Paz &amp; Hart from New Orleans.
It looks very good to my neophyte eye. I think they would add something
to the next festival and hope you can bring them in. The book is Gotta
Tango and includes a DVD. It shows their beliefs and attitudes toward
Argentine Tango. I think they are consistent with what you try to bring
to the festival. <br>

- Your book, "Gotta Tango," was delivered the other day and it looks
wonderful! I look forward to enjoying its many aspects. Thank you for
the sentiment inside ~ Good luck with its success! <span

- THE BOOK just arrived in the post. We&#8217;re so excited and can hardly
wait to watch the DVD and read the text. It surely will be very helpful
to our development as tango dancers, the next best thing to having you
around to teach and coach us regularly.
If we weren&#8217;t just starting to get ready to go out to a milonga this
evening I&#8217;d settle down with it right now. Oh, okay, maybe I&#8217;ll take
just a little peek. We can be fashionably late. <span

- Gotta Tango has arrived. I love it, although I haven't had the chance
to study it yet. To me this beautiful book is already a classic, and
lifelong teacher and companion for the rest of my tango journey.<br>
