I am happy to share
with you what I have realized as the honor and gift of having Alberto
Paz &amp; Valorie Hart visit your community. It is really thrilling
that you have the opportunity to host them in your city&#8212;because I know
how much you and your community stand to gain from the experience!<br>
Alberto &amp; Valorie are unlike any
other tango teachers I have
encountered anywhere because they combine their passion for and
profound understanding of the tango with their unparalleled skill as
teachers and their incredibly generous natures.
I heard someone say once that they &#8220;never had to relearn anything that
Alberto &amp; Valorie taught&#8221; them. It couldn&#8217;t be more true. The
hodge-podge of &#8220;steps&#8221; and &#8220;patterns&#8221; and confusing techniques of so
many other teachers left me with no real understanding, no real
progress, no educated passion for the tango before Alberto &amp;
Valorie came to Tallahasee, FL a couple of years ago. <br>
They have developed a method of
understanding and learning the dance
that is natural, thorough, and effective. I go out of my way to attend
their workshops and private lessons&#8212;even in other communities&#8212;any
chance that I can because with them I am truly in the hands of masters.
Oh, it&#8217;s hard work, to be sure. But it is complete and inspiring and
worth everything I put into it.<br>
I am in Jacksonville, FL now and our
community here has recently hosted
Alberto &amp; Valorie for the first time! The Jacksonville community is
just getting going and there is a new, eager energy here that benefits
from the attention of the masters. Alberto &amp; Valorie do much to
raise the level of dancing in the community&#8212;making individual dancers
feel delighted by their progress and giving them the tools and
confidence to step out onto the floor. Starting the weekend after their
visit, the community here began holding a regular, weekly milonga,
organized by our local leader (who is also the one who hosted them
here)! Through Alberto &amp; Valorie we learn about the culture of the
tango, the music of the tango, and have access to support in
community-building efforts (including suggestions/methods to organize
events and information) as well as access to the larger, national, and
even international argentine tango community. And of course, they offer
community leaders with training in the dance itself&#8212;so that the
nurturing that they bring with them can continue when they are gone. <br>
Alberto &amp; Valorie have so much
experience in creating and growing
healthy communities of tango dancers all over the country. The
argentine tango has entranced me, which I&#8217;m sure you can understand.
And with a deep love, humble respect, and complete confidence I can
recommend that you whole-heartedly embrace the opportunity Alberto Paz
&amp; Valorie Hart present you! We are very fortunate to have them here
in the U.S. --and in our lifetime!! <br>
I feel like my words can only say so
much.... cheers.<br>

I&#8217;m a member of the tango community
in Tidewater, VA where Alberto Paz
and Valorie Hart just finished a week of classes and related events.
We&#8217;ve been lucky enough to have studied with them twice, the first time
being last spring in a nearby city. If you are a new organizer and are
curious about what Alberto and Valorie have to offer, I hope you&#8217;ll
visit this website and would like to hear from dancers who have
experienced their teaching. First of all, as dancers, not only are they
technically excellent, they also express the emotions of tango. They
have developed teaching techniques that make their instruction clear,
direct, and understandable to students. Further, they are scholars of
the music, the history, and the culture of tango. And they are
interesting, intelligent, amusing people. Because they have been at
this a while and genuinely want to work with each community, they are
people with whom you can discuss goals, expectations, and the best ways
to promote a good outcome for all. I know that what I&#8217;ve said is very
general, but I hope you get the idea that we are very happy to have had
a second encounter with Alberto and Valorie and that we look forward to
future workshops, classes, and private classes with them. If you have
specific questions please email me. Best wishes with your tango group.<br>

</span>I met Alberto and Valorie
during the Winter of 1998, in
California . I had just made the decision to learn Argentine Tango,
after going to the show &#8220;Forever Tango&#8221; twice in San Francisco and
watching the movie &#8220;The Tango Lesson&#8221; by Sally Potter. I needed someone
from the Culture of Argentina to teach me Tango, as I had intuitively
sensed how deep Tango seemed to touch the different delicate layers of
the human emotions. Someone had given me their phone number. I called
and during the preliminary introduction, I explained the reason of my
call: &#8220;I needed someone to teach me Tango, but more than the steps. I
wanted to understand the &#8220;Culture&#8221; behind the moves&#8221;. After his
delighting usual chuckle, he said: &#8220;Well&#8230;you found me. I think I can
teach you what you&#8217;re looking for&#8221;. These words marked the opening of a
marvelous door to my quest.<br>
The first lesson consisted in Walking
and&#8230; Walking, with no reference
to any figure. I had to learn how to keep my partner in front of me,
therefore, learn how to &#8220;negotiate&#8221; curving and straight paths. &#8220;Tango
is a walking dance&#8221; Alberto said. Little did I understand at the time
all the profound implications of that comment. Confident I was, sensing
I was studying with someone who knew what he was doing.
After several months of private and semi-private lessons, Alberto and
Valorie encouraged me to start going to the milongas to dance. The
dance floor is the place where my many lessons taken, would show, they
kept saying. <br>
About 6 months later, as I signed up
for the Nora&#8217;s Tango week-end (a
major Tango event in the San Francisco Bay Area in July) I began to
realize how fortunate I had been to study with Alberto and Valorie. I
had been very well prepared to understand the instructions of other
great Tango Masters such as Fabian Salas, Carlos Gavito, Tito&#8230;etc. that
I encountered at the event and later on, studied with. <u>I had NEVER
had to go back and unlearn or correct anything
Alberto and Valorie have taught me</u>.
For that I will be forever
grateful to them. <br>
In the world where many delve and
stagnate in so much fantasies and
half information dispensed by people who have not yet studied long
enough and yet want to be &#8220;teachers&#8221;, it means a lot to find the right
Master Teachers such as Alberto and Valorie, from the very first
neophyte&#8217;s steps. To teach is also to express love. It is a gift and a
talent. I was very impressed with Alberto&#8217;s ability to go into my mind
and explain to me a difficulty I was experiencing. He was thus able to
help me identify the problem and therefore put me in a better position
to correct it. Infinitely patient, Alberto and Valorie NEVER looked at
their watch to &#8220;check the time&#8221; of the lesson. I remember one day where
I was so enthusiastic about a subject we were studying, that I kept
working on it and asking questions, over and over. At some point,
Valorie went to the kitchen for a quick brake. I continued with Alberto
for a while. Then, Alberto walked toward the couch, slumped onto it
with his hands resting on his head. At that moment, Valorie came out of
the kitchen and Alberto, looking at her said with a very calmed and
exhausted voice : &#8220;I think we&#8217;ve created a monster!&#8221;. She burst out
laughing. I quickly realized&#8230;checked my watch and (Oh my God!) we had
been working for over two hours already, for a lesson that was meant to
last one hour. I too laughed, apologized for my &#8220;stubborn focus&#8221; and
departed shortly after to allow my teachers some rest.
That availability of a Teacher, that Love expressed tirelessly for the
student, has marked me forever. <br>
There is an indescribable joy in
helping a student receive the
information and to see that information take shape in his/her mind. The
length of time it takes to accomplish the goal does not matter anymore.
That is the modus operandi of Alberto and Valorie. Very attached to the
historical accuracies, Alberto opened my eyes to many facts about
Argentine Tango. He is the one who made me realize the contribution
that the African descents in Buenos Aires , along with the Italian,
Spanish and Indian, had brought to the birth of Tango. After the class,
it was customary to sip a cup of tea, graciously offered by Valorie, in
the kitchen of their wonderful house (I called it &#8216;The Temple of
Tango&#8221;, because everything in that house was breathing Tango). During
that special time, casual comments often helped me open my heart more
to the Argentinean spirit. Alberto and Valorie gave me a gift of a
priceless value, an added life lasting joy to my existence: the
experience of Tango. They opened a window on the garden of my soul to
let more rays of the sun and more warmth of Love rush in. Thank you!<br>

A personal invitation, powered by a strong conviction.<br>
I invite you to sample the best tango
education that is available in this country. Everyone is used to
reading
superlatives these days, but I want to tell you that this is unlike any
tango
festival or workshop elsewhere. Traveling teachers will come and go,
but there
is no substitute for Alberto Paz and Valorie Hart, Tango
EDUCATORS, at the pinnacle of their profession, a profession that
is very different from tango teaching of top tango dancers. <br>
Alberto and Valorie
will help you understand the whole world of tango, which of course
includes,
most importantly, tango dancing. They will give you a fresh perspective
that is
sure to bring you another dimension to enjoying tango and tango
dancing, in a
way that nobody else has done for me, and for countless other fortunate
tango
dancers all over the world. <br>
In the world of great tango dancers who teach
tango, and great tango teachers who teach tango, Alberto Paz and
Valorie Hart
are in a class altogether separate. To get a taste of what&#8217;s in store
for you
take a look at Alberto and Valorie&#8217;s
website, which is neither fancy, nor peppered with their own pictures,
and to
start with, find your way to the link entitled &#8220;Tango our Dance.&#8221; If
there was
ever a documented goldmine of tango, this is got to be it.<br>
I have had the opportunity to take group and private
classes across the country with upwards of 60 tango dancers and
teachers from
the US, Europe, and South America, some of whom were truly excellent
teachers,
and it may come as surprise to some readers, that not all of the
excellent
teachers were Argentinos. I have also counted 13 teachers who I
consider The
Masters with whom I have had the privilege to study tango in private
lessons,
and I have had the good fortune of learning an immense amount, of
tango, and
about tango, from each and every one of them.<br>
What I can say about Alberto Paz
and Valorie Hart EXCLUSIVELY is, in a nutshell, this: every tango
dancer, man
or woman, at any level, owes it to himself or herself to study tango
with
Alberto and Valorie at least once, the earlier in one&#8217;s tango life, the
better.
No exceptions, no qualifiers to that statement. I was fortunate to find
Alberto
and Valorie early in my tango career, and I wish every tango dancer
could have
the same good fortune as I had. Tango would be all the better for it,
for all
of us. I sincerely hope you will make the best of this opportunity.

reside in post Katrina New Orleans. We have performed, given master
classes,
lectures
and workshops in cities across America, from Anchorage to Miami, from
San
Francisco to New York, and hundred of cities in between, as well as in
Italy,
Portugal , the UK, the Netherlands, Germany and the Philippines. We
have
been instrumental in developing new communities, training qualified
local teachers and encouraging efforts to preserve, foster and educate
people on the core social and cultural values of the Argentine Tango
music, poetry and dance.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We take pride in being masters of improvisation and we encourage
dancers of all levels and all ages to explore the possibilities of
dancing with freedom on the spur of the moment, with confidence and an
educated understanding of the music and structure of the dance. We have
also created, choreographed and produced the musical revue &#8220;LIVE
FROM THE TANGO BELT&#8221; premiered at the New Orleans TangoFest in 2003.
We also choreographed and produced&nbsp; &#8220;RED HOT TANGO&#8221;, a dance revue
based on the social dance history of tango featured at the 2005 New
Orleans TangoFest. In addition, we published EL FIRULETE, the Argentine
Tango magazine from 1994 to 2002, and are the authors of GOTTA TANGO, a
reference book and DVD on tango dancing.<br>
<br>
Since 1997 we have applied, quantified, and applied a wealth of
knowledge
we were given by the Pugliese family and other extraordinary teachers
from the golden years. We have develop a widely recognized clear and
fair
methodology for teaching the core concepts of the structure of the
dance.&nbsp; VALORIE&#8217;s classical training and musicality prompts
comments on her fluid and expressive dancing and her pristine and
pretty footwork. We teach and dance
the traditional and authentic
concept of improvisation developed in the late 1930's and practiced
by dancers in the social settings of the Buenos Aires dance halls to
this date.</div>

PAZ was born in Argentina and grew up
in the streets of Buenos Aires, the son of a blue collar family from
the Northern province of Tucuman from where they migrated to Buenos
Aires in the early 1940's seeking a better life.<br>
ALBERTO graduated from the School of Electrical Engineering of the
University of Buenos Aires in 1967 and in 1968 he moved to
California. After four years working as a Video Systems Engineer in
Los Angeles PAZ moved to the Silicon Valley in 1972 seeking a future
in electrical engineering. For the next 20 years he worked for small
high-tech video companies, finally founding his own in the 1980s. But
by the end of that decade, PAZ felt there was something missing in his
life.<br>
<br>
ALBERTO began working at radio station KIQI in San Francisco as a
soccer announcer and color commentator in 1988. In 1990 he produced a
nighttime program doubling up as DJ playing South American music. Every
now and then he would spin a tango from the station's collection and
the phone lines would light up. The music brought back memories of home
from listeners who grew up all over South America, and they
wanted to hear more. Soon he switched to an all-tango format. To gear
up
for the show, he took a two-week trip to Buenos Aires, snatching up
books
and music, absorbing the history and culture of the music. He learned
a lot of things that were already somewhere in his mind. For the 25
years he lived in Argentina, he had totally ignored the tango he heard
every day at home. He grew up with rock &amp; roll and cumbias.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
What PAZ uncovered was a rich history of music, dance
and culture that was largely undocumented. At that time there were
no English-language histories of tango. Since then PAZ tracks down
the dance's roots with a disciple's fervor, having written a number of
essays under the "Pacho to Piazzolla" title.
</div>

<div
 style="padding: 5px; position: absolute; left: 5px; top: 4140px; width: 900px; font-family: arial,sans serif; font-size: small; color: black;">Inspired
by a second trip to Buenos Aires, PAZ
returned to Sunnyvale ready to play more tango music. Soon he was DJing
milongas and classes, but he never danced himself. He had grown up with
the prejudice that tango was something one learned at a younger age. In
Buenos Aires if men weren't good by age 18, they might as well forget
it. Men who didn't know how to dance the tango, found out that no woman
would dance with them.<br>
Even though ALBERTO grew up in Argentina surrounded by the culture of
the tango, he felt awkward when he took his first steps in 1991. For
the first six months he found the dance a trial. After
a while, PAZ learned a few steps, but never really applied himself.
Then, at a milonga in San Francisco one night, he realized that he was
the
only Argentine in the room and the only one not dancing. That night PAZ
made a commitment to learn tango. Like
so many other Argentinians, he was rediscovering what his parents
already knew. Within six months he began to think there was hope.
That was in 1993. One year later the musical show Forever Tango
came to San Francisco for a four-week engagement, and ended up having
an impressive ninety two week run. <br>
<br>
ALBERTO became involved in all
aspects of promotion, assistance and personal attention to all members
of the cast, who considered him the "Godfather of the tango." Then in
1995, on a whim, ALBERTO attended the Stanford Tango Week and
saw HART leaning against a dance studio door.<br>
<br>
While PAZ was discovering tango, HART was living a successful life in
New York City, running her own business, oblivious to the
dance that would change her life.&nbsp; One night while she was making
a pasta dinner with a group of Argentine
friends she met through her corporate event planning business, someone
put on a tango album. An Argentine friend boasted that he would teach
her tango. But it only took a few steps for them to
realize that no one in the room could dance it. As with PAZ, the dance
had passed these Argentines by.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
They promised to take lessons, and HART's interest was sparked. When
she heard about Stanford's tango event, a two-week-long,
eight-hour-a-day tango celebration featuring some of the world's best
dancers, she had to check it out. She showed up in Palo Alto just
curious,
not looking to change her life, meet anyone or fall in love. But then
she danced with PAZ. Not till she met ALBERTO did she feel comfortable
dancing. He produced a safe haven for her to dance. They danced and
talked and got to know each other. At the end of the week they parted,
keeping in touch via&nbsp; phone and fax.<br>
Tango touches people at crossroads in their lives. There is something
deep about the experience of connecting with someone. HART's mother had
just died, young and suddenly, during the time VALORIE was introduced
to Argentine tango. That made her realize that life is short. She was
approaching her birthday and suddenly she thought, where did the years
go? Three months later, ALBERTO visited her in New York and asked her
to come to Sunnyvale. She packed her bags and left New
York behind.<br>
<br>
VALORIE HART is art-school trained by choice of higher education,
holding a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. Her varied artistic interests
covered both areas of performance and plastic arts. She was
a child performer, classically trained as a dancer. Her mother was
a dancer who gave up a promising career for marriage and motherhood.
Mother
ran a "store front" dance school for children. VALORIE studied ballet
under&nbsp; MadameVlaska Slovoda, a Russian teacher of certain renown,
who had been also her mother's teacher<br>
<br>
VALORIE's childhood was spent teaching at her mother's school, dancing
in various productions and preparing for a professional career.
However, HART was more interested in becoming a painter and
a writer. At age 16 she was presented with choices about how to
continue
her higher education. She chose art school, starting with the Art
Institute of Chicago and continuing in New York City at Pratt
Institute, School of Visual Arts, Art Student's League, NYU Film
School, Parsons School of Design.<br>
<br>
All along her educational period, VALORIE continued dancing
off-Broadway and in summer stock. She also acquired some performance
experience holding movie extra roles, bit parts. etc. Her artisitc
career took a dramatic turn when she became a pivotal member of a rock
band, sharing lead vocals performances as well as co-writing many
of the band's songs.<br>
<br>
VALORIE also studied poetry at The New School and the
92nd Street Y with Erica Jong Michael Bennet, Edward Field and Michael
Halpern.<br>
<br>
VALORIE had a successful fifteen career as an internationally
recognized event designer in New York before being drawn to the
tango. As an artist she possesses a natural sensitivity for the
Argentine Tango, the music, the dance and its culture. Graciela
Gonzalez
was her first mentor. Esther Pugliese and Guillermina Quiroga
contributed greatly to her formation in the authentic Argentine style
of dancing, and she developed a unique quality for dancing and teaching
in a journey which began in 1995 alongside ALBERTO.</div>

dropped everything to be with each other, and not
long afterward they started a company, Planet Tango. The
long run of Forever Tango in the San Francisco Bay Area gave them the
opportunity to change the format of their local publication, EL
FIRULETE,
into a tango magazine of international circulation. They brokered
lessons
for members of the cast and for visiting teachers, arranged guided
tours
to Buenos Aires, and sold CDs, shoes and anything else related to tango.<br>
<br>
They also danced up and down the California coastline, and in 1996 they
were asked to teach their already smooth and
authentic style of dancing in Los Angeles once a week for six months.
Thus begun the most important chapter of their tango lives, one that
would eventually lead them to the source itself, the city of Buenos
Aires, and to the Salvador Sciana academy run by Esther and Mingo
Pugliese. This was 1997, and ALBERTO and
VALORIE become one of a handful of disciples of the grand
masters.<br>
<br>
Before their life altering trip to Buenos Aires, the
teaching of tango had been based on an oral and visual
discipline consisting in a "let-me-show-you and-then-you-try-it"
approach.
The dancers who had a direct connection to the 1940's golden years
didn't like to reveal their
secrets.<br>
<br>
Teaching began wit stage dancers
as a way to supplement their income, and following a prescribed set
of basic choreography. As dancers eventually traveled to
Buenos Aires they find out that they couldn't dance on the crowded
dance
floors of the city.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
