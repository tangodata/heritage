    <TD BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF"><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>The
      understanding and good use of the relative positions of the upper bodies
      leads a dancing couple to clear execution of patterns and figures while
      maintaining good posture, developing a personal elegance and establishing
      a dynamic connection between the dancers.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>
      <P>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>In this installment we will analyze
      the use of crossed feet walking in the three body positions typically used
      for displacements along the line of dance. In other words, we will develop
      a walking pattern with both dancers stepping with the same foot, while the
      relative position of their bodies varies in three different
      ways.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1></FONT></FONT>
      <P>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>It is a good idea to review past
      installments dealing with body positions. Briefly, in Body Position 1 both
      dancers are fully in front of each other, as at the beginning of the dance,
      at the cruzada and at the close. In Body Position 2, the dancers remain in
      front of each other, but with a slight shift whereby the center of the man's
      chest is aligned with the right shoulder of the woman. Finally in Body Position
      3, both dancers are also in front of each other, but the center of the man's
      chest is aligned with the woman's left
      shoulder.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1></FONT></FONT>
      <P>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>In any of these three body positions,
      both dancers move together along the same
      path.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1></FONT></FONT>
      <P>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>Remembering our previous installment,
      from the initial Body Position 1, the man executes a Salida Cruzada by shifting
      his weight immediately after his side step to his left. He then walks crossed
      feet two forward steps in Body Position 2, and with his body, he brings the
      woman in front of him on her fourth step, regaining Body Position 1 with
      her left leg crossed in front of her
      right.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1></FONT></FONT>

      </H2>
      <P>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>At the end of the Salida cruzada,
      the man brings the woman back in front of him. As she crosses left over right
      to align herself in front of her partner; the man may cross his left leg
      behind his right leg to match her cross. Their weights are on their left
      leg.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1></FONT></FONT>
      <H2>
	<FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=+0>Figure 2</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;
      </H2>
      <P>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>The man displaces her body back
      by advancing straight into her with his body walking on his right leg. The
      woman walks back a step with her right
      leg.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1></FONT></FONT>
      <H2>
	<FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=+0>Figure 3</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;
      </H2>
      <P>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>Firmly supported on his right
      leg, the man sends the woman back another step by advancing into her. As
      her left foot begins its backwards motion, he occupies the space vacated
      by her left leg moving his body into Position 3, that is, he steps with his
      left leg onto the woman's left
      side.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1></FONT></FONT>
      <H2>
	<FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=+0>Figure 4</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;
      </H2>
      <P>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>Maintaining Body Position 3, the
      man advances another step with his right leg while taking the woman with
      his chest into a back step with her right
      leg.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1></FONT></FONT>
      <H2>
	<FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=+0>Figure 5</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;
      </H2>
      <P>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>As soon as the woman plants her
      right metatarsus firmly against the floor, the man begins to turn himself
      around pivoting on his right leg. This turns the woman around on her right
      leg. The man holds her vertical on her right leg. She allows her left leg
      to close weightless next to her right leg. They are now crossed feet in Body
      Position
      2.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1></FONT></FONT>

	<FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=+0>Figure 6</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;
      </H2>
      <P>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>Firmly supported on his right
      leg, the man now extends back his left leg and brings the woman into a forward
      step with her left
      leg.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1></FONT></FONT>
      <H2>
	<FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=+0>Figure 7</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;
      </H2>
      <P>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>With weight in his left leg, the
      man extends his right to position himself in front of the woman (Body Position
      1) and then he brings her forward on her right
      leg.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1></FONT></FONT>
      <H2>
	<FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=+0>Figure 8</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;
      </H2>
      <P>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>As soon as she steps on her right
      foot, the man crosses his left leg over his right leg, and he receives the
      woman's body while she is now completely vertical on her right leg with her
      left leg
      relaxed.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1></FONT></FONT>
      <P>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>If you care to analyze the last
      three photos, you will see the familiar pattern commonly used by the man
      to take the woman to the cruzada walking crossed feet. Except that the man
      is walking back in the path normally taken by the woman, and the woman is
      walking forward in the path typically taken by the
      men.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1></FONT></FONT>
      <P>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>The creation of symmetrical patterns
      where the dancers' positions are reversed is just another example of the
      unlimited potential for improvisation. This is afforded by a rational
      understanding of body alignments and the craftiness of the man's use of La
      marca, and the full awareness of the woman of her space and balance to respond
      and dance with confidence, poise and enjoyment.</FONT></FONT></TD>
