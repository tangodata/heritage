<td><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Recently we stepped back
in time to an era when first class travel meant plenty of room to move
around, with panoramic views of the landscape, delicious meals, and sleeping
quarters. We rode the train on a teaching tour of the <b>Midwest</b>.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Inasmuch as hugs and good
wishes, mixed with smiles and tears bring people together at a train station
terminal, there is a moment in time when the imminent departure of the
train is announced for everyone to hear. Within minutes, a separation of
sorts occur. People who get on board begin a new journey. Left behind there
is a shrinking image of people waving as the train leaves the station.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In life as in the Tango,
people face from time to time, the decision to move on or to stay where
they are, content with their hands waving. For twenty-five installments,
we've been preparing for a great journey, and so with this chapter, we
begin to move on to explore the possibilities that an educated grasp of
the fundamental concepts of Tango improvisation, brings to those on board,
for the ride of a lifetime.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>We will analyze combinations
that use elements of <b><i>Giros</i></b> (turns) to the right and to the
left to create figures that are both visually appealing, and practical
in their execution within the considerations of respect for the line of
dance.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The figure illustrated below,
begins at the point where a <b><i>Salida Simple</i></b> would, that is,
man's axis is on his right, woman's axis is on her left; bodies aligned
in the <b>Body Position One</b>. As a matter of taste and dance protocol,
no self-respecting dancer would attempt to execute this figure at the beginning
of the dance. Preferably, the initial position is arrived to, at the end
of <b><i>La Base</i></b>, when the man has backed up twice and is ready
to open to his left. This is the position indicated in <b>Video Frame One</b>.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Holding his axis on his right,
the man rotates to his left sending both, his left foot behind and the
woman to his left side forcing her to change axis with an opening of her
right leg. This position is captured in <b>Video Frame Two</b>.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The initial motion to the
left of the man (which if initiated in the proper position would be in
the direction of the line of dance), is now changed to the man's right.
He accomplishes this by rotating back to his right on his right axis, and
stepping deeply into the woman's left side, changing her axis back to her
left (which is where the man is now) with a back opening of her left leg.
<b>Video
Frame Three</b> shows the moment he advances into the woman's left side.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The motion into the woman's
right is both a forward step and the beginning of a spin to the left, thus
another change of direction of the <b><i>Giro</i></b> begins to take place.
We occasionally call the resulting action as a <b><i>Vaiven</i></b>, a
descriptive word that indicates "going (<b><i>Va</i></b>) and (<b><i>y</i></b>)
coming (<b><i>Ven</i></b>)" as the man "goes" up onto his left leg, spins
while vertical on axis, and then "comes" down with a back step of his right
leg (or viceversa, of course).</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>This <b><i>Vaiven</i></b>
to the man's left, is what characterizes the figure we are analyzing because
as he goes up on his left leg and begins to spin on his axis, he makes
the woman rebound from her left back step, changing the direction of her
<b><i>Giro</i></b>
from right to left, as she now changes weight to her right leg and begins
to advance forward in a <b><i>Giro</i></b> to the left. <b>Video Frame
Four</b> captures the moment the man is suspended on his left leg spinning
to his left.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The duration of the spin
is such that the woman will step one more time as she continues her <b><i>Giro</i></b>
to the left with a forward motion of her left leg.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In <b>Video Frame Five</b>,
the man finally "comes" down from the <b><i>Vaiven</i></b> with his right
leg, and receives the woman's forward step on his left. To facilitate,
he keeps his left elbow close to his body while opening the left shoulder
to make room for the woman.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Holding axis on his right
leg, the man continues to rotate his upper body to his left to keep the
<b><i>Giro</i></b>
in progress. As he opens to his left with his left leg, the woman opens
her right leg and changes axis to continue going around the man into his
left side. Observe <b>Video Frame Six</b>, and notice the alignment of
the bodies. They are not dead in front of each other, but slightly to each
other's left. That is, the woman needs to understand that she has moved,
and continues to advance into the man's left side and not to force her
body (and thus the resulting steps) to stay in front of or to the right
of the man.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The advanced Tango dancer
can "see" these "video frames" as they are being created on the spot, mainly
because he is the one creating them with a sense of timing and space, but
also because he and she know how to dance Tango.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>So, a closer examination
of <b>Video Frame Six</b> brings to mind a familiar position which is none
other than the beginning of a <b><i>Salida Simple</i></b> (or to the <b><i>Lead-and-Follow-by-the-Numbers</i></b>
practitioners, Step 2 of the <b>Eight Count Basic</b>).</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The ability to "see" where
we are going, is an integral part of an oral pedagogy we inherited directly
from masters with a lifelong dancing experience. It is also a by-product
of our own dedication to put into practice those concepts, and to quantify
them into a teaching methodology which has opened the <b><i>mystical doors</i></b>
of the Argentine Tango to regular folks everywhere our line of dancing
take us.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The end of the figure is
as important as its beginning, so recognizing the opportunity to resume
progressing into the line of dance, the man turns once more to his left
holding axis on his left leg, and then he "sees" that his motion has brought
the woman back into his right side as she pivots on her right axis. When
he advances to his left with a forward crossing of his right leg, she crosses
her left leg behind to keep going into the man's left. This is <b>Body
Position Two</b>, as captured on <b>Video Frame Seven</b>. It is also the
second movement of a <b><i>Salida Simple</i></b>, or the first movement
of <b><i>La Base</i></b>, but that is irrelevant, since the options available
to the creative dancer with a knack for improvisation are countless.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The <b><i>Giro</i></b> to
the left is smoothed out as the man advances with a forward opening of
his left leg, rather than pivoting on his right to continue a circular
motion of the woman around him. She opens with her right in a backwards
motion, changing axis into her right side (where the man is now) as they
begin to walk into wherever the moment may lead to. <b>Video Frame Eight</b>&nbsp;
looks very familiar to the position prior to the end of a <b><i>Salida
Simple</i></b> (the man closes his right leg with a change of axis, allowing
the woman to catch up as she is coming from his right side into his left
with a crossing of her left leg over her right axis), which in terms of
the structure of the music is one of several natural positions where to
put a "<b>period</b>" to end an eloquent "<b>paragraph</b>," such as the
figure we just completed.</font></font>
