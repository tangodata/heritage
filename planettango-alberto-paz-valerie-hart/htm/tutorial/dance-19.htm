<td BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF"><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Over the
years, it has become natural to find dancing opportunities all over the
world. For those who travel, it is a blessing of sorts to be able to connect
with a local Tango community at almost any destination, whether it is in
the US, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and even Buenos Aires.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The experience varies whether
the travelers are a couple, or single men and women. Couples have a slight
advantage in terms of dancing, because if anything else fails, they have
each other, so they can dance to their hearts content. Single men have
to deal with an unknown group of women, and their experiences will vary
according to their social skills, and to a certain extent, their ability
to dance with any stranger. Single women fair the hardest task, since they
have to deal with the idiosyncrasies and protocols of the local community,
having to balance their desire to dance with the uncertainties of how to
meet their objectives.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Our experience has taught
us that being schooled in the improvisational aspect of the Argentine Tango
is a major plus to be able to dance as a "single" or as a couple at any
place and with anybody on the spur of the moment, under any floor conditions,
and to any selections being played by the local music person.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>&nbsp;
<h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+0>The benefits of improvisation</font></font></h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Improvising a meal is a feat
that most people relish when on a short notice a bunch of friends or associates
drop by to visit. Imagine how difficult it would be to improvise a meal
if upon opening the kitchen cabinets you were to find them empty or containing
only a box of instant mashed potatoes.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>By definition, to improvise
is to invent on the spur of the moment. Similar to being able to improvise
a great meal by making good use of a very well stocked cupboard, the Tango
dancer can improvise a great dance by putting to good use a comprehensive
set of navigational patterns. What has navigation to do with Tango dancing?
<b><i>Just give me the gancho. Show me how to swing the leg. If you can
lead it, I can follow</i></b>. Indeed, there is still confusion after more
than ten years and thousands of hours of classes at every possible level
and location. The concept of Tango improvisation and how it relates to
navigating the dance floor is overlooked because of the insatiable appetite
of those who continue to accumulate figures and steps out of context, for
the sake of keeping their interest in dancing alive.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In its simplest form, the
Argentine Tango has kept generation after generation of Tango dancers interested
by the mere fact of spending hour after hour, three minutes at a time,
holding each other close while navigating the dance floor to the sound
of the music.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In its most complex form,
the Argentine Tango continues to keep generation after generation of Tango
dancers interested by the simple reason of holding each other close while
navigating the dance floor at the sound of the music.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Given the choice of knowing
lots of steps and patterns and recognizing lots of Tangos and orchestras,
the Tango dancer always chooses the latter, because the nature of the music
dictates the kind of Tango to be danced. The solemn renditions of Osvaldo
Pugliese may call for symbolic pauses to smell the roses, to blend the
inhaling and exhaling of life from our lungs with the invisible sway of
bodies in place. The precise beat of Di Sarli may invite for window shopping,
brief side trips through softly lit back alleys before returning to the
main road for a happy stroll under the stars.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>To improvise on the dance
floor men and women must be aware of what is required from each of them
individually, and what are the elements that each must contribute to make
the improvisation a shared experience, and a great one at that. The universality
of these requirements and elements would make it possible for men and women
to dance at ease with anybody on any crowded dance floor anywhere in the
world.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>&nbsp;
<h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+0>The mans' role</font></font></h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The primary responsibility for
the man is to carry the woman in his embrace in a comfortable and safe
way around the floor. He must be aware of the motion of other dancers,
the conditions of the dance floor, and the particular music being played.
To navigate around the floor he must have complete control of the woman's
movements. He must be ready to react to sudden interruptions in the flow
of the line of dance in front and behind him. He must be ready to handle
unexpected changes of direction dictated by the presence of obstacles,
or by the actions of other dancers. If this sound much like what a driver
has to be aware of to go from point A to point B, it is because navigating
the dance floor is similar to moving in heavy traffic. However, while you
may drive an automobile and take good care of arriving at your destination
without any scratches or bumps to the shiny metal, Tango dancing for the
man is about taking care of a precious human being that has trusted her
safety and movements to him.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>As the couple embraces,
imagine the two of you carrying a tray loaded with a priceless crystal
set. The four extremities that support the precious cargo become critical
to insure a smooth journey and an enjoyable ride. Dancing with our bodies
becomes natural as we concentrate on the embrace and let our legs follow
our bodies providing at all times the proper support and the shock absorbing
effect that makes our bodies move in a smooth, elegant, sensual, playful,
etc. way.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>It is the man's responsibility
to know how to move his partner with clear weight changes to insure that
all four feet are on the ground at all times, except on those situations
when one of dancers will stand on one leg in order to embellish with the
other free leg.&nbsp; For the man this includes flicks, back displacements,
kicks and hooks. Before engaging in the execution of any of these figures,
he must insure that his partner is solidly grounded with legs open and
both feet on the ground.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>To be able to move his partner,
the man must be solidly grounded, that is his weight must be allowed to
rest on the support leg. Moving your partner does not mean pushing and
shoving with your arms. It is the rotation of the upper body around the
support hip that creates the necessary torque to bring the woman off balance
from one leg to the other one, provoking her displacement from her initial
balanced position to a new balanced state at the end of the displacement.
Standing firmly in one position, the man should be able to provoke a movement
of his partner forward, backwards or laterally. When the dance floor really
gets crowded, this skill is priceless because it allows for great dancing
in short circular trajectories while still being able to improvise all
kinds of patterns in heavy traffic, without banging your partner against
objects or other dancers around you.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>&nbsp;
<h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+0>The woman's role</font></font></h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Perhaps, the concept of the
role of the woman in the Tango is the most difficult to define and the
hardest to grasp because it is closely surrounded by contradictions. On
the average, every woman has had a "bad man" in their lives, or know somebody
who has. The way society is structured, women are at a disadvantage in
that they need to try twice as hard to obtain half of the benefits that
men get in just about every aspect of life. To make things worse, just
about every other form of partner dancing requires that a woman follow,
that she be on her proverbial toes to follow, that she allows to be dehumanized
and called a follow, that she be stripped of a full participation in the
dance. Not so in the Argentine Tango where equality and mutual respect
are fundamental. In Tango we trust. The first thing a woman must trust
is herself. She must acquire posture and balance in order to allow her
partner to have total control of her movements, while she uses her technique
to respond to motion with clear weight changes finishing each displacement
comfortably balanced.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Her upper body must be quiet
and relaxed to be able to receive the changes of direction marked by her
partner. Her waist must be loose so her legs don't fly in response to alignments
of the upper body. Her legs must be firmly on the ground at all times except
when her partner puts her on one leg in anticipation of a leg flick, a
hook,&nbsp; a sweep, etc. She needs to understand that her free leg moves
in response to the man's actions, so therefore she must complete all weigh
changes in such a way that her upper body can rotate on the grounded hip.
The free leg moves in a relaxed way in response to the rotation of the
hip, much as a protractor that has a pointed needle that pierces the paper
which allows for a rotation on the axis of the needle to provoke a smooth
drawing by the pencil attached at the other end.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>These concepts grouped under
the heading of essential techniques for men and women are the subject of
our Tango Barre and Tango Bar sessions aimed to empower women and men to
dance with freedom, on the spur of the moment, anywhere, at any time, with
any partner.</font></font></td>
