<td BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF"><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In the
land of the do-it-yourself and the cult of self-reliance, those of us who
decided to learn to dance the Argentine Tango are constantly lectured on
the "unstructured and improvisational aspects of this urban dance," and
then we are immediately bombarded with an endless array of steps, figures
and <i>Spango</i>, a list of Tango names that are supposed to help the
English speaking students memorize steps and patterns better. Adding to
the mystification of the "unstructured and improvisational dance," are
the myriad of traveling “teachers” who carry suitcases full of steps, judgments
and ego. At the local level, there are a few methods and systems in circulation
that contribute to the bedlam that most “beginners”, “intermediates” and
“advanced” level dancers face on a daily basis.</font></font><img SRC="../images/lampazo.gif" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 NOSAVE height=290 width=160 align=RIGHT>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>When Humphrey Bogart asked
Lauren Bacall how does one whistle, she responded, "put your lips together
and blow..." Had he asked her how do you dance the Tango, she might have
said, "stand up straight, embrace your partner and walk..."&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Yet, after almost ten years
since the Argentine Tango fever caught this nation by storm, the general
proficiency and the overall quality of the social dance leaves a lot to
be desired. Everybody is a performer at heart and the local milonga is
the stage to make the dream come true.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Americans are an independent
lot, quickly given to instant gratification with a penchant for fixing
things that are not broken. As a result of that, the important aspects
of systematic learning and the hard work that goes along with that, are
easily overlooked and in the few cases where a syllabus or courses have
been developed, the tendency has been to catalog a lengthy list of steps
and figures which then are used to pigeonhole people according to their
capacity to memorize and repeat the steps and figures using a ranking system
similar to the ones used by the American and International Ballroom community.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>If we accept the fact that
the Argentine Tango is an urban social dance that has been in existence
for over 100 years, and if we acknowledge the fact that throughout several
generations of dancers the core concepts and elements of the dance have
only changed as society mores have allowed more freedom of interaction
between men and women at the social level, then we may open our minds to
a series of concepts, vocabulary and structural forms, that in many different
ways, we have learned at one time or another from some of the most talented
and gifted dancers and teachers from Argentina.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Putting aside the silly jealousy,
envy and down right competitiveness among the masters and the journeymen
that follow them, (traits that, if used with caution, you’ll see soon are
a necessary ingredient for the attitude required to absorb the Tango in
your organism) we are able to rescue fundamental concepts that compiled
in a didactic context, may form the basis for a "dancer's manual" of sorts.
To that extent, in instances where specific concepts or ideas identify
a particular individual we will give the appropriate credit.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font size=+1>The basic structure of the Argentine Tango dance&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>At the very core of the dance
structure, we may define and identify four distinctive set of movements:
the <a href="../ourdance.htm#Salida">Salida</a>, the <a href="../ourdance.htm#Caminata">Caminata</a>,
the <a href="../ourdance.htm#Giro">Giro</a> and the <a href="../ourdance.htm#Cierre">Cierre</a>.
Each one will have variations, substructures and exceptions but as we pick
apart each one of these elements we will discover what <a href="teachers.htm#&quot;P&quot;">Mingo
Pugliese</a> calls "the embodiment of the Tango". That is, out of a finite
number of recognizable body positions for the couple, it is possible to
improvise a countless number of patterns, steps and figures.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><b>The Roles Dancers Play</b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>During the learning process,
both men and women must understand that their responsibilities on the dance
floor are quite different. Firstly each one must assume control over their
own balance, which translates to finding the correct axis in order to develop
the most comfortable posture. Second, both the man and the woman must learn
and understand the concept of marking (<a href="../ourdance.htm#LaMarca">La
marca</a>). This concept is unique to the exhilarating experience of improvisation
on the dance floor and unfortunately for many confused dancers in this
country, is commonly replaced with the ballroom concepts of leading and
following. The confusion has been aggravated by some Argentino teachers
who don’t bother with pinpointing the radical difference between marking
and leading and following because of expediency, selfishness or ignorance
of the conceptual language differences.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>A Thesaurus search of the
verb "to lead" will produce the following partial list of alternatives:
to guide, to usher, to steer, to drive, to direct, to conduct, to escort,
to precede, to go before...&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>We ask the men, regardless
of experience, when was the last time you “led”, "drove", "ushered", "went
before" your lady partner on the dance floor? According to <a href="teachers.htm#&quot;D&quot;">Rodolfo
Dinzel </a>and others who corroborate this concept, the woman always moves
first and the man follows right behind (the notable exceptions are the
not-so-gentle-men who charge ahead with their feet, dragging the women
like a sack of potatoes. They are actually “leading” the lady to believe
that they care little for their partners).&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font size=+1>The Three Steps of Tango</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>One of the understated facts
of dancing Argentine Tango is the availability of four feet and four cardinal
directions where the couple can move. Simply put, there are only three
steps in Tango: the Side step, the Forward step and the Back step. The
direction is relative to the orientation of the upper body.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><img SRC="../images/sidestep.gif" HSPACE=10 NOSAVE height=300 width=150 align=LEFT><a NAME="StAside"></a><b>Step
Aside</b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>A side step is typically
shoulder wide and in the direction of either shoulder. In other words,
it is a lateral movement that begins with the leading foot extending right
or left, followed by a body weight change to that foot and ending with
the unloaded foot coming together with or without another change of weight
(this will be dictated by the next movement).&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><b>Being forward</b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>A forward step requires similar
mechanics only that the leading foot advances in the direction where the
upper body is pointing. Once that the leading foot’s metatarsus has found
the ground, the body weight transfer begins with a slight flexing of the
leading foot in order to “pull’ the body weight to its axis. This avoids
the “bouncing effect” that occurs when the body is “pushed” by the trailing
leg. Once the weight transfer has been completed, the heel of the trailing
foot is off the ground and the trailing leg is relatively elongated. Then,
and only then, the forward step is completed by letting the trailing foot
“fall” next to the support foot. At this point both knees are together
and slightly flexed ready to continue.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><b>Know When to Back up</b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>A back step is executed in
the reverse order. First the leading foot moves back in the direction where
the back of the upper body is facing until it finds the floor with its
metatarsus. Then, as the heel touches the floor, the leading leg “pulls”
the body for the weight transfer at which point the trailing foot “falls”
next to the other ready for the next movement.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><b>A Position of Strength</b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The position where one leg
is slightly flexed with the foot completely on the ground and the other
leg is elongated with the heel off the ground is perhaps the one most likely
to be in use most of the time while dancing. Should somebody enter the
room and take a still photograph of that position, it would be impossible
to guess whether the dancer is in the process of stepping forward, stepping
backwards, or in the middle of a left or right hand turn.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>With these three steps a
couple could dance in straight lines or in a box, going forward, sideways,
backwards, sideways, etc., etc.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In order to turn one more
element is necessary: the swivel or pivot, which is a rotation of the upper
body along the vertical axis of the supporting leg and executed by flexing
the knee, lifting the heel of the ground and spinning on the ball of the
foot.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>A sequence consisting of
a forward step, a pivot on the leading foot followed by another forward
step is the most popular Tango figure universally known as the <a href="../ourdance.htm#Fwd8">Forward
Ocho</a>.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Likewise, a sequence consisting
of a back step, a swivel on the supporting leg with both feet together
followed by another back step is commonly known as a <a href="../ourdance.htm#Back8">Back
Ocho</a>.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Finally, we'd like to quote
Pablo Pugliese: "the Tango begins with the posture and finishes in the
legs". There is an anatomical and a psychological reason for paying attention
to posture. From an anatomical point of view, finding a comfortable embrace
helps the enjoyment of the dance.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The psychological aspect
involves a positive winning attitude. The dancers must believe they are
the best they can be.</font></font></td>
