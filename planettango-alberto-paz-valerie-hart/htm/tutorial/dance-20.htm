<td BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF"><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>A male
Tango dancer approaches each dance as a journey around the dance floor
inspired by the music and the presence of the woman he's holding in his
arms. A female Tango dancer enters into the embrace of the man who's transporting
her around the dance floor and lets her body become an expression of the
feelings and emotions that she and her partner create as the journey takes
them to unexpected levels of intimacy.</font></font>

<td><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>This is an instance where
there is no degree of separation, no personal space and no boundaries.
The man and the woman bond together, they extend their arms and surrender
their bodies, coming closer to each other. The music is playing, their
bodies are dancing, their breathing is silent. It seems so sublime and
simple; it cuts to the chase of personal relationships; it brings the best
of humanity in an act of trust and generosity. It has no ulterior motives
and it repeats itself time after time in an universal setting that knows
no geographical, racial or cultural barriers.</font></font></td>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The Tango was conceived as a
dance because of the primal needs of men and women to play out their lust
and desire. This happened at a time and at a place where our minds can
not even begin to comprehend, so we are left with isolated sound bites,
stereotyped flashes and unredeemable cliches.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>What brings us to the question
of why people choose Tango as their dance? Which produces a predictable
answer. Who knows? Human nature is so complex that whatever forges each
person's personality in life seems to converge to an intrinsic desire to
belong, to be part of, to be where everybody knows their name. And then,
we seldom know if the person we're embracing is truly sincere and genuine,
or we are just fictional characters in their undisclosed life story.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>According to most accounts,
the combination of a fortuitous outing to a theater to watch a Tango show,
with an overwhelming desire to emulate the choreographed depictions of
passion and emotions on the stage, has inspired many to join or start a
Tango community at home. The release of cult Tango movies has also added
more converts to the legions of Tango addicts. Then, local residents in
search of a pastime joined the Tango classes, attended Tango parties, and
a mushrooming number of cities where Tango is danced has dotted the world.</font></font>

<h2>
Real men ask for directions</h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>For a while, a basic eight step
sequence was taught so women could get their dances trusting that the men,
notoriously singled out as incapable of asking for directions, could at
least "lead" them in tedious repetitions of the same thing. The recipe
was simple: separate the men and the women, teach each group their steps
and then spend the rest of the evening trying to get them to agree on who
forgot the next step or went the wrong way. There is nothing more unsettling
than the sight of a bossy woman and a sheepish man on the dance floor.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The sooner preconceived
life stereotypes are left outside the class or the milonga, the better
equipped men will be to learn to navigate the dance floor with confidence.
It is a difficult task, it is demanding and it is not about "leading" but
about going places without getting lost even when exploring every single
opportunity to take another route.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>It would be fair for women
to reflect on the fact that men go to the milonga to dance with women who
don't behave like their mothers. The trade off for men not getting bossed
around and treated like surrogate partners is to assume the role of a man
who feels confident about himself, who knows where he stands, who knows
where he is going, who is prepared to deal with the unexpected and cares
about the woman he is dancing with. For that, men need to be humble yet
confident to ask for directions from qualified and experienced dancers
and teachers.</font></font>

<td><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Guys who grew up kicking
around a soccer ball may have a more natural body coordination and balance
than those who grew up using their bodies to hit each other while carrying
or hitting a ball with their hands. This is a fact and not racial profiling
as evidenced by looking side by side at a marathon runner and a swimmer.
Their bodies conform to the discipline they perform.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Pundits may quickly point
out that smoking, drinking, chasing young women and putting on some layers
of lard around the waist may be the ingredients required to become a milonguero,
but these conclusions are ridiculous as are the often mentioned tales of
men-dancing-with-men and the rose between the teeth as prerequisites before
dancing with a woman.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Tango dancing is deceiving
and Tango dancers can easily be deceived by promises of instant gratification
when mechanical execution of the flavor of the month pattern is rewarded
with awe rather than derision. There is no shortcut to Tango for men who
want to dance Tango well. And here is where the real problem exists since
dancing Tango well is a matter of opinion, a matter of taste, and a matter
of convenience. Or is it?</font></font></td>

</table>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>It is not a coincidence that
an overwhelming majority of Tango dancers over the last one hundred years
were people with rudimentary education at the bottom of the socioeconomic
scale. Dancing Tango was part of their life, and to reach the status of
good dancers the men went through a rite of passage dictated by a rigorous
system of promotion among their peers. The learning process took place
on the streets, in the neighborhood bars, in the social clubs and every
place where the male population gathered to drink, gamble and pass the
time. Women were not part of these functions because of strict codes of
conduct that required them to conform to the existing moral standards.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Men had a clear goal that
kept them focused through months and often years of&nbsp; training: that
was the day they would be invited to attend their first milonga and be
introduced to the rituals of the night life. When they stepped on the dance
floor for the first time, they were prepared to face the music, to embrace
a woman and to weather the critical eye of their peers.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Things are different today.
Tango dancing is found everywhere and the pressures and demands of yore
no longer affect the ability of men to dance. Yet, today as yesterday,
the formula for success is deceivingly simple when approached with commitment
and conviction.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<font size=+2>Begin with the music</font></h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Identifying and understanding
the sounds of at least the Top Ten orchestras of all times is paramount
to approaching a plausible compromise between being a native of Argentina
and being in the Tango scene only for a short period of time.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Roberto Firpo, Francisco
Canaro, Osvaldo Fresedo, Julio De Caro, Juan D'Arienzo, Anibal Troilo,
Osvaldo Pugliese, Carlos Di Sarli, Miguel Calo, Alfredo de Angelis could
arguably make up the Top Ten for some, give or take a few names. The whole
idea is to listen to the music; to learn the sound of each orchestra; to
recognize the most popular songs. No matter how you do that, but don't
ever accept the commercial claims, much less the wrong notion that there
is music for beginners and music for other levels of dancing. Above all,
remember that there is only one level of dancing, yours.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Know where you stand</h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Attitude, presence and intention
are subjective factors that contribute to the development of good posture
and balance.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Men must be solid on the
ground with their weight mostly on the ball of their feet, yet their overall
silhouette must project upward with their upper torso relaxed and firmly
standing tall. The arms must create a comfortable space for the women to
dance. The right arm surrounds her torso, and the raised left arm extends
to the side to bring her right arm forward.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<font size=+2>Move with confidence</font></h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>When ready to move, the body
weight rests mostly on one leg, with the knee slightly flexed, effectively
compressing the muscles on that leg so the other leg has elongation to
reach forward, or backwards. Just before the free leg begins to travel
"hanging" from the hip, rotate the upper body on the leg where your weight
is, so the shoulder associated with the free leg goes in the opposite direction
that&nbsp; the leg. This counter body motion insures that the movement
will not cause the body to fall onto your partner, but rather produces
a movement that will make her extend her free leg in the opposite direction
of her shoulder. Effectively, the bodies are centered between both legs
firmly on the ground. There is a slanted line that runs from the legs to
the upper torso that creates the optical effect of leaning bodies and crossed
legs. Moving confidently following the beat of the orchestra transmits
a clear sense of motion to your partner. Before you know it, you are dancing.
Now watch where you are going.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<font size=+2>Aiming to please</font></h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Dance floors have at least one
thing in common: they have boundaries. So the object is to work around
the floor using a variety of routes. It is commonly accepted that dancers
generally progress around the line of dance in a counter clockwise manner.
This does not imply forming a conga line. At one time, certain salons in
Buenos Aires observed a rule that required dancers to keep their place
in the line of dance, that is, no passing or being passed, sort of dancing
in-place on a merry-go-round.</font></font>
<table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="100%" >
<tr>
<td><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>As with everything else
people talk about the old days, never mind. Consider primarily the rudeness
of banging your partner against somebody else, or allowing her to be run
over by another insensitive couple. Then, don't let it happen. And although
it shouldn't have to be said among reasonable adults, don't use your partner
as a prop for your ridiculous fantasies of imitating Rudolph Valentino.
He was not a Tango dancer.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Sooner or later you'll reach
the end of the dance floor and you'll have to veer left the way you turn
around the corner. You aim your body without forgetting to keep your partner
in front of you, and your legs follow. While at it, you may begin to move
laterally instead of forward. This allows you to change your front so you
can walk backwards. Now you must be aware of bringing your partner into
you.&nbsp;</font></font></td>

<td><img SRC="../images/ValPaz22.jpg" NOSAVE height=177 width=180></td>
</tr>
</table>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>As you begin to see that the
longest path always consists of single displacements put next to each other,
you will begin to create short patterns as you zig zag your way around
slower or stationary dancers. At times you may find yourself cornered.
You may want to bring your partner back and forth keeping her in front
of you until you find a new front to aim to.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Random repetition of these
and whatever else you may come up with to navigate around the floor falls
under the general category of improvisation. Dancing without a prescribed
set of patterns frees the imagination and let the bodies fuse into a dancing
couple to the rhythm of the orchestra. There are names for the things you'll
be doing, but when the time comes to learn more about the name of the&nbsp;
patterns, you'll see the possibilities of more exciting journeys rather
than another mental block to stiffen up your act.</font></font></td>
