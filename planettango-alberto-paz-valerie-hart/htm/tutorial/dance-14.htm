<td BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF"><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>A working
understanding of floor navigation and the dynamic interplay of the body
positioning, create plenty of opportunities to enjoy a Tango, any Tango,
with any given partner, and with floor conditions in effect at the time
that you step on to the dance floor. During the learning process, certain
patterns and figures become so internalized by sheer repetition, that body
memory inhibits the ability of dancers to improvise with creativity out
of many situations created by the presence of other dancers and their own
trajectories around the dance floor.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>For, example, walking on
the side of the partner, (Body alignments 2 and 3) can be boring and repetitive
if the result is another cross for the woman followed by a resolution or
an occasional forward ocho. What should be used as a base from where to
build a variety of movements becomes “the basic” and it limits the possibilities
of flowing around the dance floor in a seemingly continuous pattern that
includes the three fundamental body displacements (forward, backwards and
sideways) connected with rotations of the bodies over the support axis.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The term <i>media vuelta</i>
is commonly used to describe a body turn north to south for example, if
we call north the direction in which the body is facing before the execution
of a media vuelta. Either of both dancers can do a media vuelta at the
same time or individually. Visually, a media vuelta is a body rotation
over open legs, that is, after the legs open in a forward direction for
example, the body turns in the opposite direction of the leading leg. To
clarify further, visualize the typical forward ocho. The turning on the
forward ocho is in the direction of the leading leg. What differentiates
the media vuelta is that it is done with both feet on the ground which
allows the dancer to continue moving in either direction, north or south
after the turn, depending on how the weight is transferred at the end of
the turn. In the case of the man, this allows him to correctly mark the
next move for the woman.&nbsp;</font></font>

</b>After stepping on the right side of the woman with the right foot,
the man marks a side step to the right for the woman with a rotation of
his upper body). <b>[Center]</b> Once she is on the man's left side (body
position 3), the man marks a forward step for the woman as he continues
to rotate his upper body to the left. As she sets her left foot down, the
man is half way through the media vuelta. Their bodies are perpendicular
to each other (body position 4). <b>[Right]</b> As the man finishes his
rotation, he marks a pivot for the woman on her left who then completes
the first part of a forward ocho. At this point they both are in body position
2 again, and he can indicate the next movement bringing her forward to
complete the ocho, or sending her back by advancing on her side.</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>A media vuelta to the left
begins after the right leg is opened forward. Weight is transferred forward
so the right foot is flat on the ground and the knee is naturally flexed.
The left foot remains on the ground, firmly pushing down with the metatarsus.
At this point, the body is supported by both legs. Next, the upper torso
begins to rotate left as both legs elongate to keep the heels off the ground.
Most of the weight is now on the right metatarsus which serves as the initial
rotating axis. At the end of the turn, the body is facing opposite to where
it started, and the forward leg is now the left. To continue in the new
direction, the weight is transferred to the forward leg. To go back in
the original direction, the weight is transferred to the trailing leg.
The object of weight transfer is to provide a balanced axis for the body
so the free leg can naturally close and then open in the direction of travel.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>If this media vuelta is executed
by the man, the woman connected throught the embrace, will begin with a
back step, then open to her right moving to the left of the man, and as
he begins the rotation she'll advance forward and turn on left leg to end
facing the man in body position 2.</font></font></td>
