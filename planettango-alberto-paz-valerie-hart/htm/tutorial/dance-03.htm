<td BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF"><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>One of
the often used analogies to describe the motion of Tango dancers on the
floor is that they walk like a feline. The subtle, catlike, cunning displacement
of good Tango dancers speaks plenty of connection, sensuality and finesse.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>How, then, can we learn to
move like a cat, while watching where we are going, taking care of our
partner and listening to the music? Did somebody hiss, “technique”? Absolutely!
As with any other discipline, learning to dance the Argentine Tango requires
technique in order to develop a dancing personality of your own. Otherwise,
the temptation to imitate others is the curse of the lazy dancer. Think
about a handful of world class Tango dancers, <b>Pablo Veron, Miguel Angel
Zotto, Osvaldo Zotto, Pablo Pugliese, Eduardo Arquimbau, Carlos Copello</b>,
you name them. They all are superb dancers, they all can teach and they
all dance completely different from each other. The same thing applies
to the ladies: <b>Milena Plebs, Alicia Monti, Miriam Larici, Marcela Duran,
Cecilia Saia, Lorena Ermocida, Esther Pugliese</b>, and the list goes on.
Spectacular dancers, yet, each one dances with a unique personality and
style.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The common denominator is
technique. Technique is acquired with knowledge and honed with practice.
Of course, we have not overlooked talent, but that is what makes those
and other stars who they are.</font></font>
<p><font size=+1>The beginning of the dance</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Many of the unique traits
of Argentine Tango dancing are the result of protocols, rituals and habits
developed along the line of time since the first man raised his left arm
and embraced a woman with his right. The salida, the beginning of the dance,
is part of the ritual of Tango dancing.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Traditionally the “best”
women dancers were seated in the front row around the dance floor. This
still takes place in many popular dance halls in Buenos Aires. The men
would either be in the center of the dance floor or near the bar from where
they could see and be seen by the ladies. The object was to make eye contact
and imperceptibly ask a lady to dance with a nod of the head. A lady wishing
to accept the invitation would indicate so with a minimal motion of her
eyes, her lips, or her head. At this point the man would walk towards the
lady without losing eye contact, a sort of reassurance that the eyes he
was looking at, were looking back at him and not for some other guy coming
from behind him.</font></font>
<p><img SRC="../images/dance-2.gif" HSPACE=10 NOSAVE height=332 width=160 align=LEFT>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>After accepting the invitation
to dance, the lady would wait until the man got closer to her table and
then she would get up and step forward with her back to the table and facing
the dance floor. The man would stand in front of her facing away from the
center of the dance floor. The accepted protocol expected that the couple
would not disturb the dancing of others already dancing, so their first
step would have to be in the line of dance, i.e., the man’s side step to
his left, the lady’s side step to the right.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Then, a left turn of the
man's upper body would line them up to join la ronda and they would proceed
to complete what has became known as the salida, the beginning of the dance,
which commonly ends with the cross, but it doesn't have to necessarily
happen that way.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Do you have to start with
a step to the side? No. Can you start with a back step? Yes. In which of
the two situations can you see the space in front of you? Which of the
two situations would minimize the possibility of stepping on somebody dancing
behind you? Rather than engaging in a philosophical debate over which is
the best way to start moving, we suggest that you use common sense. There
are some crowded situations where you are almost forced to move in one
and only one direction. You may back out of your driveway, but would you
back out on a freeway?</font></font>
<p><b>The <i><a href="ourdance.htm#Salida">Salida</a></i></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>At the beginning of the dance,
both dancers are facing each other and their legs are closed, that is their
feet are together. The first step keeps the dancers facing each other but
their legs are open. Throughout the dance both dancers will be repeating
the same movement, opening their legs, then closing them. This is a simplistic
concept yet it is the way we dance. There will be times when one dancer
opens the legs while the other keeps them closed or viceversa. Tango dancing
requires a mark from the man, a motion by the lady and a subsequent motion
by the man. Sort of the way a cat displaces his body by moving one leg
at a time. The combined bodies of the dancers and their four legs move
in a similar fashion.</font></font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="../images/dance-3.gif" NOSAVE height=231 width=473></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Every time we step we open
our legs. Every time we bring our feet together before the next step we
close our legs. So, stepping to the side is the same as opening the legs
wide. Stepping forward or backwards is the same as opening the legs deep.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>A very commonly used sequence
for a salida consists of a side step, two steps in the direction that the
man is facing, and a return to the closed legs position. When the dancers
are in the closed legs position, their bodies are fully facing each other.
Their feet can be together or crossed.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>A typical salida then, consists
of:</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>(1) A side step to the right
of the lady. The man's body shifts slightly to the left in order to walk
outside the lady.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>(2) Two steps, forward for
the man and backwards for the woman.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>(3) A forward step for the
man and a back step for the woman who crosses her left leg over her right
to come back into a full frontal alignment in front of the man. This position
is similar to the body position the dancers had at the beginning of the
salida but now her feet are crossed.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Although the crossing of
the lady's leg is a very common occurrence in Argentine Tango, the man
has the responsibility to mark such a movement. In fact, every single step
of the Tango is marked, and this is a very important subject that we will
address next month.</font></font>
