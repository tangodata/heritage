<td BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF"><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In between
the Tangos of a set (<i>tanda</i>), a lot of conversation goes on among
the dancers standing on the dance floor. The topics of the many conversations
that ensue, cover anywhere from flirty interchanges to the latest gossip
in the neighborhood. When the next Tango begins, the sound of the conversations
blends with the music for a few seconds.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Gradually the couples assume
the embrace, the spoken word dies and a new dialogue begins. It is an unspoken
interchange that goes on between the dancers and it is based on a language
that it is unique to the Tango dance: <i>la marcacion</i>, a corporal communication
between the dancers that carries the rhythm and melody of the music from
the loudspeakers into the displacement of their bodies on the dance floor.
This fundamental aspect of Tango dancing has been systematically ignored,
misrepresented or mistakenly equated to certain aspects of ballroom dances.
As a result, many people learn to dance Tango without the benefit of understanding
the ever so important concept of <i>la marca</i>.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>There are several translations
of the Spanish verb <i>marcar</i>, the favorite being "to mark" as in tagging,
branding or stamping. Another one is "to lead" as in leading and following.
They're both way off the mark.</font></font>
<h3>
Left, right, left, right</h3>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The Spanish language is rich
with words that have several meanings. Add to that the colloquial expressions
found in different regions of Spain and in many countries of South America,
and you may begin to understand why our young Tango communities sometimes
don't understand the origin of the expression and its application to Tango
dancing. To understand the meaning of the word
<i>marca</i>, we look back
into our early childhood when we used to admire the young soldiers marching
down Avenida de Mayo on Argentina's National Day, to the beat and sound
of patriotic songs. As we entered school, we learned to march in and out
of class and school. The action of walking to the beat of a drum at a parade
or to the stern "left-right" command from an old spinster at school is
known as <i>marcar el paso</i>, to accentuate the way one steps while following
a rhythmic pattern.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>When a couple readies to
dance, an experienced female dancer expects her steps to be marked by her
partner. Most of the times, <u>if there is no mark, she will not move</u>.
More than once an Argentine woman dancer has been heard to say <i>no me
marcastes</i>, or <i>no te entendi la marca</i>, to indicate that he did
not mark or that his mark was not clear.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>She was not asking to be
branded with an X on her forehead or to have finger marks on her back at
the end of the night. She was demanding <i>la marca</i>. She was requesting
that he contributes his fifty percent to the dance. Since it does not seem
to be a fair translation for <i>la marca</i>, we might as well add the
new Tango word to our vocabulary and to our dancing technique.</font></font>
<h3>
Gentlemen, on your mark</h3>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>To properly understand the concept
of <i>marcacion</i>, we need to review the concepts of good posture and
the dynamics of the embrace. In adopting the dancing posture, the man surrounds
the woman with his right arm creating a space where she will dance. The
points of contact are her upper arm firmly set on his upper arm, his upper
arm in full contact with her body and his right fore arm and hand gently
holding her back. To complete the frame, his left arm extends out in line
with his left shoulder holding his right palm slightly upwards.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Her right arm extends out
and up and her hand rests palm down on his palm. He gently cups her hand
by closing his fingers over her hand. Shoulders lock so any motion of the
upper bodies can directly be transferred to the arms.</font></font>

<td><img SRC="../images/dance04a.gif" NOSAVE height=200 width=320></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP ROWSPAN="2"><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The
man's left arm should not be used as a pump to force her motion back and
forth. If he pushes with his left arm, she will open up when stepping back
with her right foot and her body will dance in a V-frame moving sideways
while going back, instead of fully facing his upper body. Because her right
foot will point at an angle while she steps back on a V-frame, her cross,
left over right, will leave her body at an angle instead of being directly
lined up in front of him.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>If the couple dances in a
V-frame, their dancing possibilities are dramatically limited, as certain
movements, such as walking on her left or turning to the left are difficult
to execute without exerting a toll on the spinal cord of the lady.</font></font></td>

<h3>
The mark of a good dancer</h3>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The purpose of <i>la marca</i>
is to indicate when, where and how the lady moves into the space created
by the extension or contraction of the embrace.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>For example, while doing
a four-count <i>salida</i> to the cross, his body moves slightly to her
right on the first side step. On the third step, (her right, his left)
he may subtly extend his right arm to create space for her to cross left
over right and reassume a full frontal alignment. If the intention is to
continue with a forward <i>ocho</i>, he must indicate the change of direction
by applying a slight pressure on her back with his right arm. This creates
space in front of her so she interprets <i>la marca </i>and advances with
a step forward into the space that was created just before she went into
the cross.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>One of the most dreaded experiences
is attempting to execute a turn only to realize that she "runs" away losing
the beat and possibly her balance. This could be caused by one or both
of the following reasons: her technique may not include the concept of
keeping the pace of the music or he has no clue of what <i>marcacion</i>
is needed to create space so she can move around him.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Before we digress any further,
we would like to review several concepts that affect the coordination of
motion between the Tango dancing couple.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><u>First, the lady always
walks in a straight line</u>. Better yet, she walks forward into the direction
that her body is facing, or backward into the direction that her back is
facing.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Any change of direction is
marked. There are two distinctive ways to mark a change of direction.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>To mark a side step to her
right, he applies a gentle pressure on her left side with his right arm
at the same time that his right hand firmly placed on her back stops any
further motion in the direction she was walking. This is marked as her
right foot comes together with her support leg (left in this case) on her
way to a back step. The momentum of her motion towards the back step transfers
into a side step once that her feet have come together.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Another way to change direction
is by marking a pivot, a rotation of her body while it is vertically loaded
on the support leg. If the intention is to mark a change of direction so
she will turn to his right while going back, then his right shoulder will
open to the right so the enclosure of the embrace will expand in that direction
and she will interpret that <i>marca</i> as an indication to pivot on her
left foot while opening her upper body into the space that the opening
of his right shoulder created.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Once that the spin is finished
she will once again continue to walk in the new direction that her body
is facing. To mark her a turn to his left, his upper body will turn to
his left, creating a space behind to her right. Combining these two marks
produces the familiar <i>back ocho</i> figure.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The purpose of this segment
is not to describe in detail the various
<i>marcas</i> for common movements
of the dance, but to introduce the ever so important concept of <i>marcacion</i>
against the backdrop of important aspects of the dynamics of the dance.</font></font>
<h3>
Follow me, please</h3>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>So, after we established that
she moves on a straight line, we want to add that she moves into space
created by his <i>marcacion</i>. In case it is not obvious yet, in Argentine
Tango, she leads the way and he follows.
<u>She moves, then he moves</u>.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>This is a paramount principle
voiced by many masters but poorly translated or plainly ignored. If you
apply this concept to the simple walk that typically allows dancers to
progress around the dance floor, as the man marks the next step, he must
wait until she begins the leg extension and only advance with his body
when he has felt her metatarsus firmly placed on the floor. At this moment
the transfer of weight takes place. Her extended leg elongates and her
heel touches the floor.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The subtle delay between
the motion of the dancers is what creates the much sought after feline
elegance of the dancing couple. You can't walk like a cat because you only
have two legs. An embraced couple, combining both sets of legs can.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In essence, understanding
the concept of <b>"I move, then he moves,"</b> if you are a woman, or <b>"she
moves, then I move,"</b> if you are a man, is a significant step towards
developing the natural sway and sensual motion characteristic of the Argentine
Tango.</font></font>
<h3>
It Takes Two</h3>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>To sum up, the dissection of
a step shows two parts: the contact of the metatarsus with the floor on
the beat, and the elongation of the leg that places the heel in full contact
with the floor in between beats. When you take the time to travel with
confidence in the execution of each step, you are contributing to the quality
of the dance.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The person moving forward
must wait for the person moving backwards to firmly set foot on the floor
before transferring the weight forward and moving into the space created
by the back leading leg. In this fashion, "rock and roll" jumping is replaced
by&nbsp; a slick and dense horizontal displacement.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The forward advancement of
the foot should reach the nearest foot of the person walking backwards
and not the other way around. This also creates the natural Tango lean
where the upper bodies are in full contact while the legs are free to move.
More important, each dancer is comfortably balanced on his/her own axis.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Here is another myth revealed:
it is not necessary to open the frame in order to execute the most intricate
turns and patterns. If a man knows how, when and where to mark, and the
woman is technically prepared to move with confidence on the dance floor,
then as a dancing couple they only need the space their bodies occupy to
dance at any level of complexity.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In summary, the man creates
or changes space with the action of his right arm (in case it is not obvious,
the right arm is attached to the upper body at the shoulder).</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>We saw earlier that he can
create space for her to cross, for example. She could then, step forward
into that space to initiate a <i>forward ocho</i>. If after the cross,
motion continues with her walking backwards, he can move into the space
to turn left or right into a Tango close.&nbsp;</font></font></td>
