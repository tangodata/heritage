<td BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF"><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>A case
may be made for the long checklist a Tango dancer must go through before
stepping onto the floor. Issues of posture, musicality and types of embrace
occupy an important aspect in the minds of most dancers. Room should be
left for enjoyment and gratification.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Many times, dancers forget
to check their psychological baggage outside the milonga's door and issues
not related to Tango dancing may affect the quality of a dance or the entire
evening. The way dancers approach the exhilarating experience of social
dancing is a choice available to everybody.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>First and foremost is the
music. Endless arguments may ensue sometimes about how good or bad the
music being played at a given milonga is. Most of them are pointless as
they only reflect the pettiness, envy, mean spirit, ineptitude or plain
stupidity of those who are the most vocal in their unsolicited criticism.
Show me a "music critic" and I'll show you a mediocre dancer. When the
intention is genuine and the desire is honest, most of us can enjoy a wonderful
night out at just about any place.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The time honored most accepted
method of inviting and accepting a request for a dance, is the eye contact
and a head nod. It speaks highly of politeness, courtesy and above all
about avoiding uncomfortable and at times embarrassing experiences. It
also affords every dancer the privacy of choosing how to spend an evening.
It is unsettling being stalked by overzealous individuals or being put
into the difficult situation of accepting reluctantly or declining uncomfortably.
In spite of its popularity nobody appreciates being "used."</font></font>
<p><b><font size=+1>Seize the moment</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Dancing is a personal issue
and the first concern upon stepping onto the floor is the person you will
be dancing with. Second on the list of concerns is the traffic occupying
the rest of the floor. What you do next is your choice.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>If a lady waits for her dance
facing the center of the dance floor, the gentleman will be wise to begin
the dance with a left side step that will get them moving in the direction
of the line of dance. The closer to the outer edge of the dance floor the
couple decides to navigate, the less stationary figures they should attempt.
Using walking patterns, cadencias, changes of front, forward and back ochos,
and elements of giros, the dancers can engage in a series of movements
that will take them around the floor with grace and fluidity. A crowded
dance floor is the ideal environment for improvisation since the dynamic
closing of spaces hinders most attempts to repeat a given choreography.</font></font>
<p><b><font size=+1>The Six Count Walk</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The basis for moving around
the floor is the walk. We like to introduce the concept of walking the
very first time anybody shows up to a class. Although there are no rules
as to how many steps to walk, using a 4 step walk with a two count cadencia
can get anybody moving from the word go.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>From the base Body Position
1, (Fig. 1, both dancers chest to chest), the man marks a change of weight
to his right by slightly bending his right knee and releasing the weight
from the left leg. The lady responds accordingly and transfers her weight
to her left leg. On the beat, the man marks the first back step to the
lady who responds by stretching her right leg and planting her metatarsus
behind her. Once that she has began to move, the man steps forward with
his left foot, transfers his weight to that foot and marks the second back
step to the lady who in turn plants her right heel on the floor, brings
her full weight to that foot and passes the left leg with tone but without
power looking for the floor behind her with her metatarsus. The third step
is identical to the first one and at the fourth step the man brings both
feet together by stepping with his right foot next to his left. The stopping
of the man's forward motion is the mark for the lady to also bring her
feet together, stepping in place. Keeping the beat, the man marks a cadencia
by provoking a two count change of weight (left-right for the man and the
corresponding right-left for the woman) and on the next beat a 4-step walk
with cadencia may begin again.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>This particular sequence
allows the man to begin the next sequence with his left foot (not a requirement
at all, but convenient for what follows).</font></font>
<p><b><font size=+1>A Change of Front for Him</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Whenever the man is ready
to step forward with his left foot, he can mark a change of front by moving
at the same time that she steps back with her right foot and turning his
body to his left. The second step of the change of front will be his right
foot to the side which will complete the turn to the left. Finally, turning
the body out to his left, the man will step back with his left. All along
he must mark the lady's steps in order to keep her inside his embrace while
he is going around her changing the front.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>At the end of the change
of front, the dancers are in Body Position 2, occupying two lanes, the
man at the lady's right. (Fig. 2)</font></font>
<p><b><font size=+1>And One for Her</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>If the man considers that
at this point she has stepped forward with her right (Fig. 2), he may mark
the next step so she pivots on her right and opens her left foot to her
side while her body turns right towards him. At the same time he brings
his feet together with the weight on his left and walks with his right
foot into the inside of her right foot producing a displacement of her
right foot and a transfer of weight to her left foot. If he marks a pivot
followed by a back step, while turning right to bring his body in front
of hers and placing his left foot next to her left foot, these are the
first three steps of a giro to the right began at the end of a change of
front.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Mind blowing you say? It
can be if you bring page 16 or 17 of El Firulete to the dance floor. If,
instead you learn to identify body positions and "templates," not only
could you also write about them, but actually enjoy executing them. Improvising
is dancing on the spur of the moment, making, inventing or arranging offhand
patterns and figures from familiar elements or "templates."</font></font>
<p><b><font size=+1>Now You Try It</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>After the double change of
front, the man is facing the lady again, his left foot on the inside of
hers. Her right metatarsus is firmly on the floor so when he brings his
right leg over and walks on her right, the dancers are on the second step
of a salida so it would make a lot of sense to bring the lady in front
of him by marking a cruzada when she steps back with her right, so on the
next step her left foot can cross in front of the right while their bodies
are once again in Position 1, both feet together, chest to chest, etc.,
etc.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>If you care to count, it
took 14 movements from the time the dancers began to walk to arrive to
the cruzada. First four to walk, two to change weight in place, three for
his change front, three for her change of front and two to reach the cruzada.
Suppose that here he marks one stationary forward ocho, so she steps forward
with her right foot, passes her body weight forward, pivots on her axis
over the right metatarsus while hooking her left foot behind, steps forward
with her left foot, passes her body weight forward and pivots on her axis
over the left metatarsus while hooking the right foot behind. They are
back at the cruzada so the whole sequence could start all over again and
14 movements later they could be back at the cruzada. A grand total of
30 steps.</font></font>
<p><b><font size=+1>Side Trips Are Fun</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The fun of improvising while
enjoying great company and great music consists in the ability to take
a group of movements and link them together repeatedly, each time altering
the order in which the groups are linked together.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Our imaginary dancers have
used a 6 movement walk with cadencia, changes of front, salida to the cruzada
and forward ochos. Suppose that the second time they go through the walk
they use two steps and four cadencias, or three steps and three cadencias.
They still use 6 beats but the sequences have a different look. Of course,
walking can be expanded to any number of steps and the men can alternate
walking in front, to the left and to the right of the woman.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>While they are at the cruzada,
if the man walks back with his left foot after marking a forward ocho for
her, they are both for all practical purposes at the same Body Position
that they were at the end of a change of front (Fig. 2) so he could break
the return of the forward ocho by opening her to her side marking a change
of front for her and repeating the sequence explained before at the end
of his change of front.</font></font>
<p><b><font size=+1>What About Me?</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Native Argentine Tango dancers
understand from the word go that there are two fully complementary roles
required to accomplish the feat of dancing a Tango between a man and a
woman.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Perhaps elsewhere that is
not so easy to understand, because good teachers and role models are hard
to come by. Copying the skeleton of the dance and showing it repeatedly
in front of people only makes people wonder why there seems to be only
one person in a couple that is having all the fun while the other just
"follows and follows while making mistakes all the time."</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>It only takes a dime to make
a Xerox copy of a page of a bestselling book, but that does not a writer
make. Yes, it takes two, a man and a woman, each one responsible for finding
their own axis, capable of displacing their bodies in unison and keeping
a comfortable posture. The man provides a secure space with his embrace
for the woman to move with confidence and elegance. The woman responds
to the dynamic changes of the space provided by the embrace by displacing
her body into the changing space using her feet as support, but not as
the driving force.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>This is a lot to be said
about Tango dancing, but it leads to the conclusion that work and understanding
are necessary to properly benefit from the endless combinations that the
capacity to improvise allows a couple to create.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Exercises that involve walking,
turning, pivoting, help keep the body used to the specific moves so characteristic
of the Argentine Tango. Learning to displace the upper body with confidence
and allowing the legs to follow the natural path in which those displacements
will take them is also important. Everything we do on a straight line we
must do on a curve, both to the right and to the left.</font></font></td>
