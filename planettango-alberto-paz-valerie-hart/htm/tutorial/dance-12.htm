<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The dynamics of Tango dancing
come into play when the couple moves to the sound of the music. The space
occupied varies according to the alignment of the bodies with respect to
each other and the trajectory of every particular movement. Thus, a couple
"walking" a Tango will move in unison with their bodies traveling in the
embrace while their legs open and close to facilitate their motion.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>When the dancers decide to
execute a figure that involves turning in a
<i>giro</i>, for example, the
structure of the embrace changes, the alignment of the bodies change, and
various displacements of the bodies take place. That is, as one dancer
moves creating space, the other moves to occupy that space. The displacement
of one dancer by the motion of the other dancer is commonly known as a
<i>sacada</i>, and it is one of the most difficult moves to teach, to learn
and to understand.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Almost every female dancer
that ever uttered the disclaimer "I'm just a beginner," has had their legs
kicked by the foot, leg or knee of a careless partner infatuated with a
<i>sacada</i>. Since a <i>sacada</i> involves leg action, it is not without
sadness that we report that the cumbersome attempts of "leg dancers" to
execute <i>sacadas</i>, cause more damage to the legs of their partners
and their dance floor neighbors, and to the image of the Tango as a dance
of connection and finesse.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>A <i>sacada</i> is a body
displacement across the path of your partner to provoke a change of direction.</font></font>
<h3>
A Front <i>Sacada</i></h3>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>A typical front <i>sacada</i>
can take place on her forward motion entering in parallel or crossed legs
fashion, that is he may enter with either his right or left leg.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In the illustration, the
position of the legs follows the alignment of the upper torsos in Body
Position 6, that is, her right breast is lined up with the center of his
chest so the shoulders are at an approximate 45 degree angle to each other.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>As he marks a forward step,
he receives her motion with his right foot reaching past the front of her
left shoe, touching the floor mostly with the inner edge of his shoe. Her
weight is evenly distributed between both legs so she is in the middle.
His weight is also evenly distributed so he is also in the middle.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>To execute the displacement,
he transfers his weight forward to his right foot, bringing his body forward
as he begins to rotate his torso to his right. The resulting effect is
that the motion of his body forward and the rotation of his torso, provokes
a transfer of her weight to her front leg, a rotation of her torso to the
right over her right leg, and a displacement of her left leg as his right
leg occupies the space that her left leg was occupying.</font></font>
<h3>
Side <i>Sacada</i></h3>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>A typical side <i>sacada</i>
opportunity occurs when the bodies are aligned in Body Position 8, both
shoulders in line facing in the same direction.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The man receives the forward
step of the lady with the opposite leg. That is, if she is moving forward
with her left, he creates the displacement with his right.</font></font>
<h3>
Back <i>Sacada</i></h3>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>To execute a back <i>sacada</i>,
he needs to position himself in such a way that he steps back into the
direction in which she is traveling.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>This will require a double
step action so his support leg will travel with her opening leg and as
she sets foot on the ground, he backs into her path with his free leg.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Once that his metatarsus
sets firmly on the ground, he elongates his calf to allow his heel to settle
down on the floor bringing his body over and producing contact with her
leg and displacing her body.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>When she receives a <i>sacada</i>,
she should be already on both legs with her body in the middle. As his
body crosses her path and displaces her body, she needs to stay vertical
and balanced on her support leg because a
<i>sacada</i> will always provoke
a rotation of her body over her support leg. Please, refrain from swinging
the displaced leg like a scythe.</font></font></td>
