<td BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF"><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>When people
judge a book by its cover, they may not find the time to read it, or worse
yet, they may become "experts" at what they judged without reading. The
cover of the Argentine Tango dance book sometimes is illustrated with references
to the exotic, cliche-ladden, fairy tales about bordellos, machos, knives,
control and submission, which taken at face value may lead to create an
injustice on the dance floor.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>It is not unusual to hear
the plight of those who believe that all the fun and energy of Tango dancing
is enjoyed by the overbearing males, who already control and dominate every
other aspect of life. Then, dancing becomes militancy and technically challenged
individuals set out to "share and exchange the joys of having control,
using dominance and establishing supremacy." They lead themselves to denial
and follow a pattern to boredom.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Whether we like it or not,
authentic Argentine Tango dancing at its best, requires the physical and
phychological encounter of a man and a woman working together to fullfil
a three minute contract, which they agreed to when the invitation and the
acceptance took place.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The terms of the contract
require that the man take care of all external elements that would interfere
with the woman's enjoyment of the dance. Those external elements include
physical protection against other dancers, expert navigation skills to
become part of the dance floor and not the dance floor itself, sensible
understanding of the music style, rhythm and mood in order to dance the
music and not the steps, and a clear understanding of where the woman's
feet are, and most important of all, where he is going to mark her steps
so her feet will be placed exactly where they should go to execute a particular
movement, figure, pattern, or whatever you want to call it.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In turn, the woman is required
to know where her axis is within her own space, to allow her body to be
secured in the embrace, to respond to the mark by transporting her body
into the space created dynamically as a consequence of the mark. To do
this, she must have a clear point of support before moving, i.e., one leg
supporting the weight, and the ability to allow her "free" leg to be placed
as a result of la marca so the motion of her body is in unison with the
man's.</font></font>
<h3>
Parada at Door Number Six</h3>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Last time we proposed that knowing
how to initiate, enter, stop or exit from a <b><i>Giro</i></b> gives the
dancer a powerful tool to develop creative improvisational skills. We also
suggested that the woman's body positions in the <b><i>Giro</i></b> could
be seen as eight different doors, each numbered from one to eight, and
further, that it is required that you enter the odd numbered doors with
your left foot and the even numbered doors with your right foot.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>We described a <b><i>parada</i></b>,
a stop at the position we called <b>Door Number Three</b>. We will now
describe another <b><i>parada</i></b>, at <b>Door Number Six</b>.</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>He enters the <b><i>Giro
de Ocho</i></b> with a leg displacement as he marks a forward step from
the <b><i>Cruzada</i></b>, (Figure 1). Because he advances with his right
leg, he is entering through <b>Door Number Four</b>.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>As he steps forward, he displaces
her left foot (he produces a
<b><i>Sacada</i></b>) and he transfers her
weight completely to her right foot. He continues rotating his upper body
over his right leg while opening his right shoulder to create a new space
for her. She pivots and opens her left leg to her side. This is <b>Door
Number 5 </b>so he advances with his body and his left foot producing a
<b><i>Sacada</i></b>. (Figure 2)</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Next, he opens his right
shoulder to create new space for her to turn into. Her weight transfers
to her left leg and she opens her torso to the right pivoting on her left
leg until he stops the rotation locking his right shoulder and then releasing
it to mark a back step. At this point he "sees" <b>Door Number 6</b> and
decides not to "enter". So he locks his right shoulder, places his hand
firmly on her back, stops his rotation and moves his right foot to touch
parallel her left foot. She responds to this lack of space to move by not
moving (Figure 3).</font></font></td>
