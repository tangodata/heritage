<td BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF"><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>When one
embarks on learning to dance Argentine Tango, one is encountered with as
many teaching opinions as there are teachers. Since there is no generally
accepted Argentine Tango syllabus, how the teachers themselves learn the
dance and subsequently how they teach it, is at best varied and at worst
a hodgepodge nightmare for the student.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The most asked question by
students is “why is your instruction different from the other teacher (s)
that I have had a class with.” We can only surmise that no teacher actually
sets out to give conflicting information. Each teacher thinks their information
is correct. However, since there is no standard, no school for teachers,
the information is assimilated and understood subjectively. Some teachers
get information by watching other dancers and videos and learn by imitating
what they think they see. Some teachers take the flavor-of-the-month workshop,
racking up an impressive list of “big name” teachers that they have “studied”
with. Some go to <b>Buenos Aires</b>, this being enough of a credential.
Some are the “better” and more outgoing dancers in their community and
share their “style.” Others have a good memory for the figures another
dancer has shown, and present these figures as a way to learn. Still others
are star struck&nbsp; and "adopt" a favorite dancer as a model, and only
teach the star's “style” of dancing. To be fair, most enjoy teaching for
the sake of teaching and because the Argentine Tango has taken an important
place in their life.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>To this end, we present some
of the most common myths and misconceptions that crop up. It is not meant
as a critique, but rather as an observation that will perhaps be helpful
to those that are receptive.</font></font>
<h3>
<i>Show Me The Basic</i></h3>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The first misconception is that
there is a basic step. Many other ballroom dances are taught using a basic
step that never deviates, so it is useful to memorize. Given the premise
that the social aspect of Argentine Tango is an improvised walking dance,
a basic step or pattern would be limited in usefulness. The first teachers
in recent years came from the show
<b><i>Tango Argentino</i></b>. They
were dancers, and many of them show dancers, and not teachers. When asked
to teach, they adopted certain ballroom methods comfortable and known to
their foreign students and created a basic step, commonly known as the
<b>Eight Count Basic</b>. This pattern consists of side steps, forward
steps for the man, side and backward steps for the woman, shifts of body
positions culminating in producing the cruzada for the woman, ending with
the now famous tango close. When taken as a figure, it is pleasing. When
used as the way to start to dance on a social floor it is almost useless
and frustrating. Seldom, can any one couple take eight consecutive steps
to a prescribed completion on the social dance floor. You will simply be
blocked by another couple at any step from one to eight along the way.
The memorization of any pattern is contrary to the improvised dance. The
possibility of using walking steps (forward, side, back), weight changes
in place and changing body positions (in front of, off to either side,
at an angle to each other), changing the angle of the side step, all marked
by the man, responded to by the woman, is the <b>base</b> (not the <b>basic</b>
as it is erroneously translated on some popular videos) needed by the dancers
to create patterns and figures.</font></font>
<h3>
<i>When Do I Cross, She Asks</i></h3>
T<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>he answer: when the man brings
her back in front of him while he is on either side of her. This can be
done before you even start moving. No side step. No three steps to the
cross. It can be done with either leg. He uses his upper body, which is
connected to the arm embracing her, and gently lifts the side of the woman’s
body, under the shoulder that is attached to the side of the body that
her free leg is freely hanging under, and places that free leg in front
of the support leg. It even gets better. He can mark whether she puts her
weight on the leg crossed in front, or stay with her weight on the support
leg. He does this with his own body weight change. The more usual way to
produce the woman’s cross, involves using body positioning created by using
the side step (called the <b><i>salida</i></b> when used to start a figure)
to walk on the outside of the woman. The man can walk outside for eternity.
Remember the woman always walks in a straight line in the direction her
body is going. It is up to the man to change the direction of her body,
and to move in and outside of her space, or to bring her back in front
of him from the walking on her side position. This bringing her in front
of him produces the cross, because it is the only way her feet can fall
under the direction that her body is being taken.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Gentlemen must remember that
they are creating the cross by bringing the woman in front of them by placing
her body weight to her back leg, and then to her crossed leg in front (so
Ladies should not automatically clunk to cross by immediately throwing
their weight onto the crossed foot. This is just another walking step,
transferring the full body weight and line from one leg to the other, in
this case from back to front, with a crossed foot on the front leg).The
object is to bring her body directly and squarely in front of the man.
Please be aware that these weight changes and alignments take time to execute,
so don’t run the woman out of the cross you so carefully marked and executed.</font></font>
<h3>
<i>Keep Your Feet Together</i></h3>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>This is a misconception that
women in particular, take to heart as some way of producing their first
attempt at neat footwork. It seems easy enough. Feet together. Pretty neat
feet. However, the feet are not the first things to be concerned with.
Argentine Tango (and we wager all other dances) is danced using the body
to displace and transport the legs and feet connected under it. As we walk,
there is weight on one leg or the other. As we walk from one leg to the
other the legs open and close, open and close. The leg with no weight on
it, is free for the man to place as he directs and changes the direction
that the woman’s body is being taken to.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>A better image is that of
the thighs coming close to each other as the legs open and close. If the
woman concentrates on bringing the feet together, energy is produced in
the free foot coming to connect with the other foot of the support leg.
This energy in the leg that is supposed to be free, no matter how subtle,
creates a heaviness and impedes the ability of the man to smoothly and
freely place the free leg. It also makes the woman look as heavy as she
feels to the man. Men are strong, and they can and will muscle a woman
on the dance floor if it’s the only way that he can move her. It’s not
a comfortable way for either one to dance, nor very pleasing to look at.
Some women get so carried away with bringing the feet together, that the
look like little soldiers coming to attention at every step.</font></font>
<h3>
<i>On Your Toes</i></h3>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Many woman observe that many
woman dancers seem to dance on their toes. Since most social dancers are
not trained ballerinas, this would be an impossible task for the social
dancer. It is true that the weight is placed forward on the metatarsus.
But that can be the extent of it. However it is helpful when walking backwards,
that she leads with the metatarsus and transfers her body weight over the
support leg by bringing her heel down as he advances. Some women seem to
be on their toes all the time, but they should transfer their entire body
weight and line to the support leg. At this point the support leg should
become longer than the non support leg, so that the non support leg can
dangle freely from the hip with a straight leg naturally produced by its
getting shorter than the support leg. This is produced by the body getting
“tall” on the support leg, by lifting the rib cage, which lifts the body
enough to make the non support leg get shorter. This applies to side steps,
forward steps, back steps. The idea is to always bring you full body over
the support leg under you. The line is head, breast, shoulder over the
support leg. Try weight changes in place, standing with the feet together,
shifting this body line from one leg to the other. This will show you how
much the body travels even when standing in place. When dancing with the
assistance of another person, it is easy to combine going up on the metatarsus
while lifting the rib cage, to produce a clean, confidant line completely
on the support leg, with the free leg available, dangling prettily from
the hip (to be placed in the next direction by the man, to produce seamless,
weightless and timely embellishments before the leg is placed by the man).
If the woman uses her body (rib cage) to lift herself up, she will never
hang on the man to achieve her balance or her axis. If both men and woman
make their weight changes correctly and completely, they will be dancing
“on the floor “which gives the Argentine Tango its specific look and feel,
as opposed to flying like ballerinas in the air.</font></font>
<h3>
<i>Cheek to Cheek</i></h3>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>It is often observed that a
couple has their heads together as they dance. It looks so intimate. If
the woman places her heard on the man’s shoulder or leans her head on his
head, it simply takes her off her center axis, and makes it impossible
for her to achieve and maintain her line over her support leg. If she aggravates
this by insisting that she leave her head glued to his head or shoulder,
when he tries to produce the necessary body separations and displacements
(subtle but present when dancing in the very close embrace), she will leave
her head there, and her body will move away, often producing the effect
that her rear end is sticking out. It also greatly inhibits the man from
dancing freely to be able to create any kind of figure. So Ladies keep
your head up on your vertical axis. If the couple wants the aesthetic of
heads together, the man can lean his head in towards the woman’s, and move
it away when he needs to create space and body displacements. And men don’t
try to leave your head glued to her head when you need to make space, as
you need to be on your center axis as well.</font></font>
<h3>
<i>The Strangle Hold or The Sticky Woman</i></h3>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Many women will try to imitate
a beloved teacher whom they admire. If she wraps her long arm around the
neck of her man in the most sexy embrace, this is all that the student
sees (sigh) and in turn tries to imitate. They do not realize that the
woman may be a totally trained athlete and dancer completely on her own
balance, no matter where she places her arm. For the woman, the point of
contact of the embrace, whether dancing in an open salon position or in
the very close embrace, is with the under part of her arm located directly
over his biceps. She places this part of her arm on top of his arm anywhere
in the vicinity of the top of his biceps, with her elbow positioned down.
She embraces the man’s arm with her arm, and always has contact there.
If there is any space under the arm, or if her arm does not make contact
with his arm, it is very difficult to receive the body mark transmitted
through his shoulder and arm. If you dance chest to chest in the very close
embrace, this position is still valid. Also, when the woman feels the man
creating space, by his opening his shoulders or sliding his arm away, she
should in turn slide her arm out (while keeping contact). Do not hang on
tight for dear life, and impede the effort of the man to mark the step.
If he creates space, take it and make use of it.</font></font>
<h3>
<i>It’s The Other Leg</i></h3>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>When we see a woman or a man
doing an embellishment, a boleo, a flick, a gancho, a planeo, an amague
— whatever, it seems that the leg doing the embellishment has all the energy.
In fact it is the opposite. Remember only one leg, the support leg has
energy in it. The non support leg is always free. If you produce energy
in the free leg to produce the embellishment, you will take yourself off
your support axis&nbsp; and that will create an unbalance. When you try
to use the free leg to create the embellishment, you will also become heavy
because you have energy in both legs. You will usually try to compensate
for these two problems by using your partner for balance, often knocking
not only yourself off balance, but also knocking your partner off balance
at the same time. Another thing to consider is verticality. By remaining
true to the technique of being tall on your support leg, you will be vertical
on your axis. When doing embellishments, you remain vertical on the axis
of the body over the support leg. The energy produced is produced upwards</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Enjoy the dance and keep
your balance.</font></font></td>
