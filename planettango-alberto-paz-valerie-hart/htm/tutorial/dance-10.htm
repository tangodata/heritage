<td BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF"><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Like in
any good milonga when the music stops or the tanda ends, the socializing
aspect of the encounter is a very important ingredient to round out an
enjoyable evening. What makes socializing at a milonga different from an
office party or the local bar scene is the fact that at the milonga there
are many moments of truth when we have to deal with our own issues and
those of our partners.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>What follows is an opinion
or a series of opinions based mostly on subjective aspects of the learning
process of the Argentine Tango, and by no means there is scientific data
or academic research to make these commentaries anything but positive conversation.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>We believe that Argentine
Tango is mostly about attitude and unconditional self acceptance of oneself.
To truly understand this can make a difference to whether you will ever
“get it” or you will be part of the cast of Tango zombies who night after
night stroll the dance floors.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>First we need to deal with
the thin line that separates selfishness from the willingness to choose
to love ourselves as the ones we will never lose, because our lives are
loaded to various degrees with criticism, guilt trips, fear of rejection,
negative feelings and a generous dose of what some experts call toxic shame,
courtesy of parental figures and others who never considered in their well
intended ways that they were the driving force that makes some of us to
act as human doings instead of human beings. Human doings can drive themselves
looking for more and more achievement in order to feel okay about themselves.
It is a very difficult step to love and accept ourselves unconditionally
to allow ourselves time to just be. To take time for fun and entertainment
as well as to make time a nourishment moment of aloneness. In other words,
to be willing to give ourselves pleasure and enjoyment.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Dancing Argentine Tango is
about pleasure and enjoyment.</font></font>
<h3>
Befriend your mistakes</h3>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>A man looks around the dance
floor and finds a new face looking back. A smile, a nod and a walk brings
them together and as the arms wrap around their bodies, I’m just a beginner
is overheard. I’m afraid to make mistakes is implied. I am a mistake could
be construed. Pleasure and enjoyment now takes a back seat to the intriguing
question of whether some people are more than human so they don’t make
mistakes, or others are less than human believing they are a mistake.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Because as disturbing and
uncomfortable as it is, the thought of dealing with somebody who apologizes
beforehand for upcoming mistakes is as stressful as finding ways to deal
with the ones that don’t ever, ever make mistakes.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>There is no way that we can
learn anything without errors. It is after all, (how quickly we forgot
our infant years) a process of successive approximation. First we crawl,
then we stand, then we walk after falling down many times and adjusting
our balance and trying again, and eventually we are capable to run.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Mistakes are a form of feedback,
but as the buzzer in the car may warn us about the perils of driving without
a seat belt, wearing a mask of perfectionism changes the warning into a
moral indictment. At the point of encountering a mistake we can become
so preoccupied with defending ourselves against the inner critical voices
that we miss the opportunity to heed the warning of a mistake. If a defense
mechanism also is cocked to fire back at the "attacker" with the aim to
hit his/her hot buttons, then you have a conflagration of major proportions
that gets in the way of pleasure and enjoyment. Teachers need to know how
to deal with their mistakes and the mistakes of others, and the way different
people, including themselves frame their mistakes.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Back to the attitude issue,
a good Tango seems to result from the combination of the quasi arrogant
and self confidence profile of the man and the self assertive, aggressive
in your chest, standing tall body line of the woman. These are difficult
attitudes to internalize because it means coming to the dance with a clear
understanding and belief of our individual Bill of Rights. The right to
judge our own behavior, thoughts and emotions and to take responsibility
for their initiation and consequences upon ourselves. The right to offer
no reasons or excuses for justifying our behavior. The right to say “I
don’t know,” “I don’t understand,” or “I don’t care.” The right to make
mistakes and be responsible for them. The right to seek pleasure and enjoyment.
The right to befriend mistakes as information about what works and what
doesn’t work.</font></font>
<h3>
You be the teacher</h3>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>A couple is dancing removed
from the rest of the crowd. In their own world we can’t see whether they
are giving each other pleasure and enjoyment or they are trading wits blaming
each other for their mistakes. Only they can tell, but they won't. We can
only guess unless we are one part of that couple. Then it behooves us to
know that the fear of mistakes kills creativity and spontaneity, makes
one walk on eggs, always afraid to say what we think or feel. The Argentine
Tango thrives on creativity, spontaneity and improvisational journeys walked
with poise and confidence on a solid yet trustworthy dance floor. Knowing
that mistakes will be made can help seek new information and new solutions
keeping away the belief of knowing it all. Assuming responsibility for
our mistakes and accepting them as teaching tools may develop a habit to
focus on the benefit of a mistake rather than its culpability. The same
way that a speeding ticket can be a mistake that saves our life by accepting
it as a warning to drive more slowly and concentrate on our driving, the
mistakes that suitable teachers or friends may point out to us, may save
our Tango dancing life. But before we are ready to implement our self assertive
open mind to the warnings from others, we need to make peace with our own
inner teacher, our mistakes, mistakes that we are willing to befriend,
reformat and accept as a vital element of who we are, human beings embracing
other human beings for pleasure and enjoyment while we ride the sounds
of the orchestra.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>When the music stops or the
tanda ends, we will be looking forward to repeating the ritual again, and
as we approach each other for the embrace, a glimpse in our eyes will tell
of a thousand stories and countless Tangos promising moments of pleasure
and enjoyment three minutes at a time.</font></font>
<h3>
Making a commitment</h3>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>One day sitting in our living
room sucking from a metal straw the traditional green infusion from the
Rio de la Plata known as mate, we listened how Orlando Paiva described
his younger years when in the process of learning to dance and later to
teach Tango, he had spent countless hours in front of a mirror in his room
working on every detail of his posture, foot placement, arm holding and
his desired look. Those who have seen Orlando carrying more than sixty
years of life on his shoulders, can immediately notice that there is something
especial about this man the moment he stands up and readies himself to
dance. There is a distinctive stance in his form to walk, turn and pause
that generates gasps of admiration at the fluidity, elegance and personality
of Orlando Paiva.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Many wish they could dance
like him, some have attempted to copy him, very few realize that there
is only one Orlando Paiva and he is who he is because of a commitment he
made to himself many years ago to put everything he had learned from others
into a unique style and personality of his own, while in the process developing
his own skills as a teacher.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Making a commitment to find
out what works better for ourselves is a very cool step to becoming unique
and recognizable in our style and personality.</font></font></td>
