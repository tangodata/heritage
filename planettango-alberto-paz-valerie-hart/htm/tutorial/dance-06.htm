<td BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF"><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>A major
transformation in the way Tango is danced began to take place in the late
1930s and continued well into the 1950s. It was a natural consequence of
the changes that the music itself had undergone since the decade of the
1920s. Under the premise that Tango is also music, a new generation of
musicians led by Juan Carlos Cobian, Osvaldo Fresedo and Julio De Caro
set the stage for the Tango romanza, a style of interpretation rich in
melody and sophisticated arrangements that attracted musicians with a higher
level of skills. The popular allegiances were forever torn between the
so called traditionalists, fanatics of the 2x4 beat, and those who introduced
the 4x8 and the 4x4 rhythms.</font></font>
<h3>
Turning a Deaf Ear</h3>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>For a long period, the dancers
rejected the newer Tango and continued to march at the beat of 2x4 while
the music sounded different. In this early style of Tango dancing, the
role of the woman was secondary to the competitive display of skills and
bravura of the men.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>As times were changing, so
was the social structure of the city. Dancing had spread to the neighborhoods
social clubs and more and more decent young women were allowed and accepted
to participate at these weekly bailes. Once thing that was becoming obvious
to the younger generation of male dancers, was that seasoned veterans seemed
to be dancing to the beat of a different drummer. By the late 1930s the
influence of the De Caro school was overwhelming with musicians and listeners
alike. For years, before the talkies changed the film industry forever,
the likes of De Caro, Maffia, Vardaro and Pugliese, had been playing at
just about every movie theater in town. Their sound, the sound of the new
Tango had become familiar to thousands of middle class families, who alternated
between the movies and the social clubs in search of entertainment.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>A commonly accepted story
talks about a group of dancers who began to experiment with new concepts
for Tango dancing, trying to match the sounds and rhythms of the most popular
orchestras. Carlos Alberto Estevez, who became known by his nickname, Petroleo
(nothing to do with the black gold but with the dark color of the beverages
he liked to indulge in), is credited as being one of the leading brains
behind a totally new concept of Tango dancing that involved the full participation
of the women on a 50-50 basis.</font></font>
<h3>
You've Come a Long Way, Baby</h3>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The essence of the emerging
style was based on creating figures for the women to move around the men,
and for the men to move around the women, using circular patterns that
required changes of front and a whole new set of body positions. The women
loved it. The women loved the men who could do giros and enrosques. The
men who knew how to do giros and enrosques got the attention of the women.
Sometimes they also got beat up by the locals at clubs where they used
to go to impress the women with their dancing skills.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Eventually, rather than fight,
dancers from all over the city began to keep an eye on these guys, and
gradually they began to incorporate their own spice into the new luscious
recipe. That is why people from different neighborhoods developed a recognizable
style of dancing, which was different in the shell but rooted in the same
principles developed and perfected by names like Petroleo, El Negro Lavandina,
Tarila, Kalisei, Toto, Mingo, and many others. What was important about
all these and others innovators, is that they realized the importance of
the woman's role in Tango dancing. They also recognized their intellectual
capabilities and their capacity to understand the structure of the dance
and appreciate the necessary technical skills to perform it at its best.</font></font>
<h3>
Don't Let Your Daughter Grow up to be a Follower</h3>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>A giro is the technical name
of a Tango figure executed over a circular trajectory that involves changes
of front. Master Mingo Pugliese is one of the leading authorities on giros
and he has been quoted as saying that the whole concept of Tango dancing
is embodied in an eight count giro. Those who have had the privilege of
studying under Mingo can easily understand why. We will attempt to delve
into the fascinating world of the eight count giro, its structure, its
execution, the mark and response and the freedom that its knowledge affords
the Tango dancer.</font></font>
<h2>
The Anatomy of a Giro</h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Although an eight count giro
can be entered and exited at any of the eight positions, from a woman's
perspective, a complete giro to her right begins with her right leg stepping
forward (Figure 1). The next movement requires that she pivots to the right
over her right foot while passing the left foot in one swift motion stepping
to the side so she now is firmly grounded in an open position with her
weight in the middle evenly distributed on both legs (Figure 2). Next,
on the mark, she transfers her weight to her left foot, collects her right
foot and keeping both feet together she pivots to the right on her left
foot (Figure 3). Finally, on the mark, she steps back with her right foot
planting her metatarsus firmly behind and placing her weight in the middle
again (Figure 4). On the mark, she brings her right heel down, collects
the left foot and steps to the side into an open position again. To continue
circling around the man, she now repeats the previous sequence, right foot
forward with a pivot, left open to the side, right together, pivot to the
right on her left foot, right foot back, collect with left and open to
the side.</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>If you recall last month
description of the change of front, the giro completo is a version of the
change of front on a circular path, a side step and another change of front
(forward-side-back) following the circle.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>To do a giro completo to
the left, always from the woman's perspective, the procedure is similar
but the leg sequence is opposite. First she starts with a forward step
with her left (Figure 5), then she passes the right and opens to the side
(Figure 6), she collects the left and pivots over right to the left, she
steps back with left (Figure 7), she collects right and she opens to the
side.</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Successful execution of giros
requires that the dancer carries her body along with the legs to insure
the proper mix of balance and centrifugal force that is generated at the
pivoting points. In a real dancing situation, the man must understand the
structure of a giro, he must recognize the various body alignments and
above all he must absolutely lean how to mark every step of the giro according
to the particular figure or pattern he desires to execute. For the ladies
to recognize a mark and respond with eloquence, it is important to work
very hard in achieving positive and smooth body weight transfer, upper
body alignment and a sense of balance.</font></font>
<h3>
Easier Said Than Done</h3>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Incorporating the concepts of
giros can really enhance anybody's dancing, however it is important not
to forget the fundamentals. Since the motion tends to be in a circular
pattern, it is very easy to forget about posture, body positioning, and
correct weight transfer. Conceptually, we can try to break down each movement
of a giro into its basic components for the ladies.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>One of the most common position
where a giro can begin is at the cruzada. Hopefully you have been marked
the cruzada correctly so you have moved into a space created by your partner.
As you come out of the cruzada, you will walk forward into that space with
your right foot, placing it firmly on the floor, elongating your left leg
enough for the heel to come off the ground allowing your body to shift
to the middle of the step. Without breaking a stride, you will bring your
weight entirely on the forward foot flexing the knee and you will rotate
your upper body to the right in order to provoke a spin on your right foot.
The trailing left leg should now close naturally until the body has completed
the turn and it will continue to move in a side direction to place your
body in an open position, both heels on the ground, body weight in the
center.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Next, you should transfer
your weight to the left foot without twisting your upper body in anticipation
of the next move. You will then close with your right foot and only then
open your upper body in order to produce a spin to the right on your left
foot. Once that the rotation has ended (this is marked by your partner,
but more on that next time, this is your understanding of the movements),
you will step back with your right foot opening your legs, planting the
right metatarsus firmly on the floor without falling on your heel. Your
body weight should shift slightly to be in the center of the open legs.
The next move that should be marked is a body weight shift so your right
heel goes down, your left foot closes and then opens to the left for another
open position. If you are used to dancing on your toes, you should take
extreme care to insure that in the open position both heels go the floor
so your body can be firmly balanced vertically and not leaning forward
(read falling on or hanging from your partner).</font></font></td>
