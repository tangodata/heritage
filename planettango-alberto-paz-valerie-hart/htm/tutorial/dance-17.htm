    <TD BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF"><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>As we travel
      to teach, our own education as dancers and teachers develops. Many questions
      are asked, and one of the most often is regarding how long I have been a
      teacher. In a general sense I have been teaching a good part of my life.
      My mother operated store front dance schools, and I taught classes for her
      when I was a teenager. As an eldest child, I developed a natural proclivity
      for showing my brothers and sisters how to enjoy accomplishing a
      skill.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1></FONT></FONT>
      <P>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>I often thought that I might become
      a high school teacher at the very least, but as I neared the time to make
      the decision regarding college choices, I opted for what I thought was a
      more glamorous choice of taking a fine arts degree in art school in New York
      City. A knee injury as a young adult curtailed my classical dance
      career.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1></FONT></FONT>
      <P>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>Time passed and I accomplished
      reinventing myself in multiple artistic careers. The more recent of these
      concerned an event design company that I owned and operated. As I became
      known as an employer of creative types, I found myself in a teaching mode
      again. By undertaking the training of my crew, I found an old familiar enjoyment.
      I added classes in floral and life-style design offered to the public, which
      were held regularly in my studio. Business was good, so I often donated the
      tuition for these classes to a local charity. I taught for the pleasure of
      it.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1></FONT></FONT>
      <P>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>More time passed and I found my
      way to the life of Argentine Tango (La Vida Tango). Although it was not an
      initial goal to become a teacher of this newly (to me) important art form,
      I cannot imagine that it wouldn’t have happened at some point in my development
      as a dancer and aficionado. The process was accelerated by my meeting my
      life and Tango partner. He being from Argentina, was already dancing and
      very knowledgeable about the music, history and art form. This jump started
      my
      education.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1></FONT></FONT>
      <P>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>We embarked on serious albeit
      enjoyable study of the dance and how to teach it, together. This journey
      exposed us to many teachers and coaches, musicians and historians. Ultimately
      we found what we were searching for in Buenos Aires, where we took our pivotal
      training.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1></FONT></FONT>
      <P>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>Our mentors showed us a way of
      thinking and teaching. We are indebted to them for that for all time. However,
      being thinkers and innovators in our own right, we chose not to become slavish
      copies and disciples, but rather take the good information they shared with
      us and put our own methods of organizing that respected material into
      practice.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1></FONT></FONT>
      <P>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>Honing teaching skills is a continuing
      learning process within itself. As we present material to the hundreds and
      hundreds of students we encounter in our travels around the world, we revise
      and build upon our knowledge. Many of our methods have become tried and true.
      We are producing good improvisational dancers who enjoy what they create.
      We do this in comparatively short amounts of time. We also coach show dancers
      and can create choreographies. Since there are so many other coaches that
      can produce patterns, tricks, jumps and routines for the able bodied dancer,
      we find this enjoyable, but not as profound as producing the competent social
      dancer.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1></FONT></FONT>
      <P>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>Being the female part of the couple,
      dancing and teaching the woman’s role has been a unique journey. Immersing
      myself in the culture that surrounds this dance has been extraordinary, merely
      for the fact that it is not my heritage. Learning about the music and what
      has created the music has been on par with any university level
      course.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1></FONT></FONT>
      <P>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>Schooling myself in the mechanics
      of the dance has been another odyssey of self exploration. Out of this immersion
      I have discovered ways to move; to create balance; to be creative within
      the parameters of the movements; to understand and interpret music; to release
      energy for expression. All of this has been very enjoyable, and a lot less
      difficult then I could have imagined when taking my first tortured steps
      in this
      dance.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1></FONT></FONT>
      <P>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>And who tortured me? Mainly myself!
      There was also a good sprinkling of teachers that shrouded learning this
      dance form with mystification and hopefully innocent misinformation. So many
      hang ups and expectations were pinned on this mythological social dance.
      But I’m a good time girl, and somewhere along the way I had to find a way
      to enjoy myself or stop dancing the Argentine
      Tango.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1></FONT></FONT>
      <P>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>The most enjoyable aspect of Argentine
      Tango for me, is the music. Listening for hours and days and weeks and months
      and years on end is refreshing, amusing and inspiring. So I looked to the
      music for my enjoyment. I spent many hours by myself, playing my favorite
      Tangos while trying to logically figure out what made me physically comfortable
      while dancing on my own. It always came down to simple
      balance.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1></FONT></FONT>
      <P>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>In one of my self sessions, I
      would start a simple movement and try to hear the voice of my mentors in
      my head. I would try to distill this information into actual movement, created
      solely by myself. Lo and behold, their previously elusive concepts, started
      to immediately gel and take form and make sense. Later when I went to dance
      in the partnership, many, many things went smoothly. I was onto something
      for myself and very happy. When coached again by my teachers, classes became
      that wonderful alchemy of the good student “riffing” off the good teacher,
      and vice versa. My torture had stopped. Months went by as I continued my
      solo
      sessions.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1></FONT></FONT>
      <P>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>When we teach together as a couple,
      we move around a class individually to help people. I would offer some of
      my explorations into technique to the women. Usually and immediately, they
      understood and were able to execute some part of the theory, thereby making
      an instant discovery and improvement. Like me, their confidence increased
      and they enjoyed themselves
      immensely.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1></FONT></FONT>
      <P>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>An idea began to form for me to
      give a class for women. I started by thinking about what I did not want it
      to be. I did not want to stand in front of a class and have them imitate
      my movements. I wanted to give solid reasons and ways of executing a logical
      technique. I did not want this to be a torture session or something designed
      for only the physically gifted. The average social dancer is not a trained
      athlete or dancer. I wanted to present a series of repetitive movements that
      would improve one’s dancing immediately at first, and dramatically with only
      a few weeks of work. I wanted to design a little workout that one could memorize
      and take home with them and use it when each one felt the need for a touch-up.
      I wanted a class where professional and amateur could go through the exercises
      side by side and benefit from the
      experience.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1></FONT></FONT>
      <P>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>I realized that many of these
      values echoed my very best classes when I was training as a ballet dancer.
      There were many “barre” classes that I took that often had the principal
      company members sweating right alongside the neophyte. The difference now
      would be the torture free aspect and the physical availability of the movements.
      The similarity would allude to the repetition of movements designed to strengthen
      the dancer both physically and mentally. Almost every ballet bar class in
      any studio, in any language in any part of the world has the recognizable
      movements to any ballet dancer from age six to sixty. This common language
      of movement allows one to utilize any class at will, necessity and
      convenience.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1></FONT></FONT>
      <P>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>Hence my metaphorical bar class
      was created. I wanted to call my class Tango Bar as an amusing homage to
      Gardel’s Tango Bar (and Raul Julia’s Tango Bar too). When I wrote a friend
      in Salt Lake City about my plans, he suggested “barre”, a made-up word alluding
      to the French and Russian ballet. So it became Tango
      Barre.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1></FONT></FONT>
      <P>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>While offering this class to women,
      I have discovered that by simply making this offering, I have struck a chord.
      As anyone who takes an Argentine Tango dance class knows, not much focus
      is put on the woman, and our education comes catch as catch
      can.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1></FONT></FONT>
      <P>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>I have often been asked to include
      men in the Tango Barre class, and I sometimes agree. The technique for men
      and women is the same. However, I try to make a time especially for women,
      because the camaraderie it fosters is as important as learning the movements
      themselves. My partner and I are putting together a men’s class to coincide
      with the material I present in the women’s class. Ultimately, we must dance
      together, men and women. Ultimately we want it to be an enjoyable
      proposition.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1></FONT></FONT>
      <P>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>I explain my concept, because
      as I travel I hear so many interesting comments. One charming woman in
      Massachusetts remarked that she nearly refused to come to my class solely
      based on its name using the word bar. She disliked ballet bar classes, and
      thought that anything alluding to that style of class was not for her. She
      changed her mind and attended the session, and later told me how valuable
      and useful and enjoyable it was, and how she regretted not spreading the
      word to more people to encourage them to take the class. Always in the learning
      by doing state of mind, I made a mental note to perhaps approach describing
      my class in a different
      way.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1></FONT></FONT>
      <P>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>The Tango Barre class is designed
      to be given in a four to six week cycle, with at least one two hour session
      per week (ideally I would like two weekly sessions to be the norm). I am
      often hard pressed when we travel to present an hour, or at best a two hour
      class, to a completely new group. There is a philosophy and reality behind
      the creation of the movements I present. So these classes, as are the first
      classes in the weekly cycles, involve lecture and movement. I encourage people
      to tape the class, and I try to demonstrate (and take the class to go through
      the process of theory and movement) as many of the concepts that I want to
      present in these isolated
      sessions.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1></FONT></FONT>
      <P>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>The main idea of the class is
      to use a series of movements on a repetitive basis. They start with simply
      understanding what the Argentine Tango axis is and how to get the body to
      create it and then use it to simply stand on one leg. The class progresses
      quickly with stretching exercises designed to be useful for the movements
      used in Argentine Tango. Concepts and small historical ideas are presented
      in order to give context to movement. Creating embellishment is demystified
      and put into practice at once. Giros are demystified and explained. Methods
      for connection to a partner are presented. Music is discussed and ideas presented
      for interpreting rhythm and melody. All this information is something one
      can practice at home. Any part of it is useful and doable, which one can
      put to use the very next time while on the dance floor at the
      milonga.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1></FONT></FONT>
      <P>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>The last part of the class is
      spent on questions about any aspect of Argentine Tango, technical, social
      or historical. It provides for lively
      conversation.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1></FONT></FONT>
      <P>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>The idea I try to impart to the
      participants is that if you want to become a confident dancer who enjoys
      herself, there is a bit of a commitment and some body work to do. It is not
      as difficult as ballet, or probably any other exercise class you might experience
      at the gym. It is accessible to all at any age and at any level of dancing.
      However, without making the effort and the investment of time in oneself,
      the road to learning the dance, or taking a spin around the dance floor,
      can indeed, be torturous.</FONT></FONT>
