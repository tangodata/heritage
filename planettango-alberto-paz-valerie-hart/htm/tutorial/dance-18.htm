    <TD BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF"><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>Tango is
      a social and cultural manifestation of the city of Buenos Aires which was
      first a way to dance whatever it was they were dancing to around 1878. Gradually
      it developed into a distinctive way to dance the primitive music, played
      by ear, by trios of mobile street musicians. During the formation period
      of the dance, it was a manifestation of masculine bragging and a way to gain
      the favors of a layer of females who because of the impurity of their blood,
      had to make a living dancing for a fee at the seediest hangouts of the scariest
      elements of the criminal underground.</FONT></FONT> <BR>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>So, don't let anybody fool you
      with the fable about men dancing with men at the beginning. To dance what
      they called Tango in those forsaken days of&nbsp; the last score of the
      nineteenth century, was a way of life for the male sediment of the society
      to establish a reputation as tough and rough and compete for the attention
      of the better and raunchiest female dancers. A matter of phycological and
      biological need.</FONT></FONT> <BR>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>Eventually the economic boom of
      Buenos Aires trickled down to extend a blanket of asphalt over the wilderness
      of mud, weeds, and human waste that served as playground for the primal Tango
      dancers. Forced to walk on firm ground they probably suffered from foot aches,
      swollen feet, and bad ankles, as they tried to adjust to the new shoe wear
      fashion courtesy of the economic boom. Somewhere between the crowded tenement
      they called home and the nightly hangout some called cantinas, or bars, or
      general store, they started walking with a painful strut that almost made
      them look effeminate, so they covered that up with an upper counter sway
      of their body as if to make sure that everybody saw them tall and defying,
      only noticing their arrogant and defying stance, overlooking the sore
      feet.</FONT></FONT> <BR>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>That's how the porte&ntilde;o
      walk may have evolved and made its way into the way to dance the Tango at
      the end of the nineteenth century. It had begun to make inroads into the
      center of the city, courtesy of the Europeans who found the provocative and
      erotically charged choreography irresistible during their period of highest
      decadence.</FONT></FONT> <BR>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>Meanwhile, a burgeoning middle
      class, product of the education of the sons and daughters of the original
      immigrants, began to influence the way the city continued to grow and expand.
      Money was flowing into the country thanks to ever growing exports of primary
      products, and when money talks everybody listens. Those who didn't have it
      as a result of their social birthright, became creative to get it in a variety
      of ways, the commerce of sex being by far the most popular choice. Find a
      need and fill it, is the motto of most motivational sales training seminars.
      Riding on that wave of prosperity the Tango continued to find an identity.
      Its sounds began to be preserved on music sheets, since the new generation
      of musicians, trained in conservatories, could read and write what they
      played.</FONT></FONT> <BR>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>In the mid 1920's the structure
      of the music changed dramatically. The original 2x4 rhythm was transformed
      into a 4x8 measure. The new composers, influenced by the French romanza,
      heralded their work by claiming "Tango is also music." The old guard ofmusicians
      and dancers claimed that "church music was not suitable for dancing." The
      great Tango divide ensued with orchestras led by the influence of Francisco
      Canaro, Roberto Firpo, Juan Maglio Pacho and others who continued to cater
      to the dancers, while the sexteto tipico devised by Julio De Caro and supported
      by the works of Juan Carlos Cobian, Pedro Maffia, Enrique Delfino and Francisco
      De Caro, became the standard formation for the new guard groups which saturated
      the night of Buenos Aires with their ever growing repertoire. Between the
      1920's and the late thirties, the sexteto tipico and the De Caro school were
      the seeding grounds for the greatest Tango musicians of all time: Osvaldo
      Pugliese, Anibal Troilo and Carlos Di Sarli just to name a trilogy that supported
      the greatest graduating class of Tango directors of the 1920's, 1930's, and
      1940's The dance took a dive during the Depression years and the subsequent
      mourning period that followed the tragic death of Carlos Gardel. Actually
      it was Hollywood and New York, with their money, movies and records that
      muscled their way into the consumer preferences of a new generation of
      Argentinos.</FONT></FONT> <BR>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>Towards the end of the 1930s,
      dancing became popular again, this time with an intensity that has never
      ceased since. Society had changed, the city had changed, social mores had
      changed. Dancing Tango for the enjoyment of it replaced the old compadrito's
      need to do it for survival. What provoked the change was the music, or better
      the rhythm. The nostalgic, melancholic and sentimental cries of the bandoneon
      in a 4x8 measure, were replaced by the fastest pounding and urgent digitation
      of fingers on the keyboards and buttons of pianos and bandoneons and the
      nervous picking of the strings of a double bass.</FONT></FONT> <BR>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>To take advantage of the contagious
      rhythm and the addictive beat, new forms of dancing were created by young
      innovators who saw to add the participation of the woman into the dance.
      Turns, displacements, leg hooks and flicks were to change forever the way
      couples danced Tango. A whole structure of navigation routes, and creative
      interaction between men and women conformed to the needs of the crowded salons
      of the center of town as well as to the clubs of the suburbs where ample
      space was available. But regardless of the size of the dance floor, any milonga
      that deserves to be called as such was always crowded like a New York subway
      at rush hour.</FONT></FONT> <BR>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>When the first foreigners landed
      in Buenos Aires with their choreographed Tango taught by traveling show dancers,
      locals couldn't have been more astonished if Martians had been spotted hanging
      from the Obelisco. Today they welcome visitors, and they even attempt to
      communicate in English, <B><I>four o'clock, meet at studio, teach you
      tango</I></B>.</FONT></FONT> <BR>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>Meanwhile a whole generation of
      dancers have mushroomed over the planet, and even in Buenos Aires you'll
      find "beginners" obsessed with their feet, and oblivious to the bruises they
      leave on the legs and feet of those around them not fast enough to get out
      of their way. In a morbid twist of fate, the twenty first century "compadritos"
      exaggerate their way to dance to cover up the fact that they don't know how
      to do it properly.</FONT></FONT>
      <H2>
	<FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=+0>About logic and common
	sense</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;
      </H2>
      <P>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>Having being endowed with two
      legs, the human species adapted quickly to walk without the need to think
      on which leg to move next. It was always the other one. Having our eyes in
      front of our face, there are three directions on which we can focus our
      attention. In front of us, behind us, and at either side, left or right.
      We can actually move in those directions (forward, side, back) without having
      to turn our bodies into the direction of motion. If we did that then we would
      always be moving forward.</FONT></FONT> <BR>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>As kids, we learned to walk, rather
      march, to the beat of a drum. First it was the stern look and deep voice
      of an intimidating elementary school teacher who made us march back into
      class after recess; later it was the chanting crowd at our first soccer game
      jumping up and down while singing nasty limericks about the families of opposing
      team players; then at the tender age of twenty a mean looking Army drill
      sergeant transformed us into men by making us march up and down the asphalt
      lanes of boot camp. As a result of that, our bodies have gotten used to move
      to the rhythm of "left-right-left-right" with the precision of a metronome,
      and to stop at attention, feet closed together, body upright, chest forward,
      tight butts.</FONT></FONT> <BR>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>Thanks to the simplicity of the
      first musicians that began to create the rhythm of the Tango, its beat can
      be walked, yes you guessed it, by going
      "left-right-left-right."</FONT></FONT> <BR>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>If men get comfortable with carrying
      a woman in front of them surrounding her with a safe, gentle and firm embrace,
      and if women get comfortable and accept letting themselves be carried around
      by a man who moves them to the beat of the music while navigating the floor
      to the beat of the same music, then we have the base for a wonderful experience.
      It is called Tango dancing.</FONT></FONT>
      <H2>
	<FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=+0>The Base and the theory of
	creativity</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;
      </H2>
      <P>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>From May of 98 to March of 99,
      we were hired by the Mark Hopkins Intercontinental Hotel in San Francisco,
      to teach a Tango lesson every Monday evening at their plush Top of the Mark
      night club. The task was simple enough. We had one hour to get totalstrangers,
      tourists, people who probably never again would show up for a drink on a
      Monday night, comfortable enough to be able to dance Tango later that evening
      to the sound of a live orchestra.</FONT></FONT> <BR>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>Soon after we started, a growing
      number of Tango dancers started coming earlier to join in the class. They
      were intrigued to see first time dancers moving around the dance floor, enjoying
      themselves and having a good time.</FONT></FONT> <BR>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>For quite a while we had noticed
      in some Tango teaching videos, that the translator mistakenly referred to
      the basics every time the instructor would mention la base. For us it was
      clear that the concept was to have a point of reference, a road map, a
      navigational route from which figures were nothing more than momentary detours.
      Once the figure was resolved, the dancing would resume at same point of the
      road map. As a teaching tool, having a structural base for navigating the
      dance floor from which figures can be considered an interruption or a side
      trip that bring us back onto our route once the figure is resolved, was a
      very powerful concept.</FONT></FONT> <BR>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>As a matter of logic we decided
      to combine all the possible unique movements available using both legs and
      the three possible directions where we can move to, into a pattern that allows
      the couple to travel around the dance floor. We called it, of course, The
      Base, and it is a combination of six unique movements that repeated to the
      beat of the music can get most people dancing in a very short
      time.</FONT></FONT>
      <H2>
	<FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=+0>Know your
	base</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;
      </H2>
      <P>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>The first move of the base (Figures
      1,2 and 3) is a lateral displacement to the men's left. The couple can open
      to the side by using one of their legs while the other one is firmly on the
      ground supporting the whole weight of their bodies. This allows the extension
      of the free leg so the foot can be placed, and space is created for the bodies
      to shift to when the move is completed. Starting to the men's left gives
      both dancers a clear view to where they are going so unexpected bumps or
      collisions are minimized.</FONT></FONT> <BR>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>This lateral move to the man's
      left, offers the man the possibility to make changes of front before continuing,
      by having the woman swivel on her right foot. It is also a move where boleos,
      calesitas, and planeos, can be set up as a way to alter the normal sequence
      of the base. An&nbsp; important concept as improvisation becomes part of
      the learning process from the word go.</FONT></FONT> <BR>

      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>On the second move (Figures 4
      and 5) the dancers will use the other leg to move in the direction faced
      by the man. The man's upper body turns ever so subtly to his right facing
      his partner while supported by his left hip. His right leg is placed right
      of her right leg. Turning their upper bodies with a counter body movement
      sends the woman's left leg back in line with her right, naturally keeping
      both upper thighs close and legs slightly crossed in the natural porte&ntilde;o
      look. Confusing words like collect, rub your knees, keep your ankles together,
      walk like a cat, etc. become inoperative, freeing the dancer from the hanging
      side of ham syndrome, which makes the legs heavy, conspires against balance
      and requires that they learn to lead and follow to compensate for their lack
      of improvisation techniques.</FONT></FONT>

      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>The third move (Figures 6 and
      7) is another forward step for the man using his other leg. In this case
      it is his left so his upper body counter rotates slightly to his left. This
      action places him straight back in front of the woman. It is at this point
      on the base that the</FONT></FONT> <BR>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>normal trajectory can be interrupted
      by not counter turning to the left. Instead, the man moves the lady back
      while her body is still slightly turned to her right, and then brings her
      in front of him by crossing her left leg over her right. It follows then
      that the cruzada</FONT></FONT> <BR>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>position is marked not automatically
      executed as the crowd who considers the Tango the “eleventh dance” of the
      ballroom circuit wrongly teaches it. Here perhaps it is where the major
      difference is between Argentine Tango as an improvisational dance, and
      the</FONT></FONT> <BR>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>ballroom style version using the

      with both partners in front of each other, and it involves a second lateral
      opening, in this case to the man’s right. For this move to be executed under
      total balance and body control, the previous one (as always) must
      be</FONT></FONT> <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>finished by ending
      with the body weight on the legs that will provide support for the bodies
      to be able to displace laterally in the direction of the free leg. As both
      dancers open to the side, the man will stay open (both feet on the ground)
      long enough to place her on her left leg, and then he’ll close ready for

      to the second except that the traveling direction is reversed. The man goes
      back while the woman advances forward. The counter body motion is also the
      same with the man slightly rotating his upper body to his right to face her.
      Since the navigation duties still remains with the man, he must make sure
      that he begins to extend his left leg back first, to create space for his
      displacement and for her forward advance. He uses his right forearm to keep

      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>Letting the bodies do the dancing
      and maintaining complete connection all the time, the lateral moves allow
      for changes of front for both the forward and the backward moves, providing
      the dancers with a very effective, efficient and simple way to dance around
      the</FONT></FONT> <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>floor. As this
      becomes a natural way to navigate, each position affords the opportunity
      to break the sequence with natural figures (cruzada, forward and back ochos,
      cross feet salida, giros, etc.) that end always in one of the six stages
      of the base. The dancers can then resume navigating without the annoying
      effect on the flow of the dance floor caused by the Eight Count Basic, Salida
      to cruzada, Tango close, and the execution of figures out of
      context.</FONT></FONT> <BR>
      <FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>We have found that working la
      base (side-forward-forward-side-back-back), and understanding the concept
      of breaking the sequence with natural figures at each position, builds a
      very high degree of confidence from the word go for both men and women. They
      are free to dance immediately, learning how to listen to the music, rather
      than spending wasteful time resorting to memory to guess each other’s move.
      Connection is rapidly established, as dancers realize that both must contribute
      100% of their attention, their balance, their axis, and their bodies for
      the sake of an enjoyable spin around the floor. It is also a very powerful
      tool for the veterans who continue to be chained and shackled to the lead
      and follow method, but are offered an opportunity to dance the Tango the
      way it is done in Buenos Aires.</FONT></FONT></TD>
