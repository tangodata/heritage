    <tr>
      <td><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">It is sadly
amusing
to read about teachers who ask their students to tap each other's
shoulders
and/or back according to the rhythm of the music to feel really
wonderful
about being massaged after a vigorous dance class, under the pretenses
of learning musicality to improve their tango dancing.</font></font> <br>
      <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">This brings creepy
memories of
another
teacher who keeping a straight face told a captive audience at a
musicality
class, that she was capable of dancing the bandoneon sound with one leg
and the violin sound with the other one.</font></font>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Musicians know
that "<i>El que toca nunca baila"</i><span style="font-style: italic;">
      </span>(A musician never dances). Let us challenge
anyone
to debate our contention that musicality has nothing to do with one's
ability
to dance tango.</font></font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">There is ample
evidence
that not a single one of the thousands of musicians who played tango
since
at least the 1920's, ever engaged in the social activity of tango
dancing.
Further, consider the famous quote attributed to Enrique Santos
Discepolo,
a poet, journalist and philosopher, "Tango is a sad thought that it is
danced." There is not a shred of evidence that Discepolo could dance
his
way out of a paper bag. Not knowing (or wanting) to dance tango, he
made
a name for himself composing music and writing memorable lyrics. He
knew,
as many do,&nbsp; that tango is multidimensional. It can be danced, it
can be played, it can be sung, it can be listened to. It is safe to
assume
that Juan D'Arienzo, "el rey del compas," never danced a tango in his
life.
By the same token, nobody has ever praised Pepito Avellaneda or
Petroleo for singing tangos or playing the piano, violin or bandoneon.</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">The introduction
of musicality
as an intrinsic element to be able to dance tango, seems to be another
folksy American consumer's contradiction like veggie burgers, decaf
coffee
and dancing tango to Piazzolla. It is almost certain that nowhere in
Europe
or in South America there exists this ridiculous concept that dancers
must
be
taught musicality before they can dance. Tango dancers, that is.
Because
those who dance foxtrot, swing or rock and roll would laugh if they
were
required to attend musicality classes before they can dance to Up the
Lazy
River, In the Mood, and Rock Around the Clock very well, thank you very
much.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">What is most
saddening, are
the cheap shots and outrageous displays of disrespect dished out to
professional
teachers and dancers under the excuse of not being capable of teaching
musicality. While bashing the real teachers, there seems to be a
desperate
need to elevate to the rank of teachers, anyone with the latest gimmick
aimed to keep people from having to face their lack of coordination to
walk around the floor keeping a relatively simple beat.</font></font> <br>
      <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Any educated
individual
knows, or can look it up in a dictionary, that musicality is the
quality
or state of being musical; it is the sensitivity to, knowledge of, or
talent
for music. Being musical in turn, is having the pleasing harmonious
qualities
of music (melodious). In other words, having an interest in or talent
for
music.</font></font> <br>
      <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">By contrast, dance
is the
performance of a rhythmic and patterned succession of bodily movements
usually (but not necessarily) to music. No musicality or&nbsp; musical
talent is required for dancing. Rhythm helps. Deaf people can dance.</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">From the dawn of
civilization,
humans have been dancing to primal rhythms produced by the stomping of
their feet, the clapping of their hands, and the striking of objects
against
objects. The conception of the tango did not happen until the drum
beating
of the African slaves permeated the lower strata of the Buenos Aires
and
Montevideo society. By and by the dance acquired a form before the
music
could be identified. Over the next hundred years, the rhythm of the
tango
drove generations of men and women to the dance floors of Buenos Aires.
They in turn, as time went by, influenced the evolution of the music
from
its primitive 2x4 signature beat to the post De Caro 4x8 rhythm.
Generation
after generation of dancers have followed Canaro, D'Arienzo, Di Sarli
and
Pugliese from club to club, from CD player to CD player, performing a
rhythmic
and patterned succession of bodily movements with a fanatical zest.</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">There were other
musicians
who tried with a vengeance to eliminate the dancing out of tango,
ironically
because dancing had nothing to do with musicality ("Tango is also
music,"
was their mantra). It was Piazzolla who set out successfully to get rid
of the rhythm of the tango to keep away dancers from disturbing his
recitals
for espresso drinking snobs. His universal success in adding yet
another
dimension to tango is underscored by the narrow perception of those who
try to teach musicality to their feet (to dance Piazzolla, perhaps?)
missing
the rhythms of the forest by staring at the stiffness of the trees.</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The <i>Chan-chan</i> of Tango</font></b>
      <br>
      <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Counting and
collecting
steps is definitely not what Argentine Tango is about. There is a
structure
of the dance, as we have seen from previous installments. And this
structure
is made of blocks of movements, that when done in groups of up to four
components, &#8220;match&#8221; the rhythm of the music perfectly. So often, we are
asked, &#8220;how do I dance to the music?&#8221; A better question might be, "how
do I <i>chan-chan</i> to the rhythm?"</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Argentine Tango
music is
no different than any other popular music, in that for the majority, it
is written in 4/8 time signature. For most of us, who are non
musicians,
what does this mean? In non musician terms, it means that there is a
measure
of music eight beats long, and within this measure, groups of four main
(down=Chan) beats are counted, not exceeding the measure of eight. It
can
be counted out in two groups of four.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Take any piece of
popular
music - disco, swing, a ballad or even a tango, and start to count
along
aloud. Count one, two, three, four, one; two, three, four. Or - one,
two,
three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Repeat this throughout the whole
song. You are now chanting 4/8 time. You can also call out the
upbeat(chan),
or the &#8220;in-between&#8221; beat, along with the stronger down beat, which will
double the counts ONE and TWO and THREE and FOUR and.</font></font> <br>
      <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">While counting,
chanting
or calling the rhythm of the song, walk or better march, stepping in
time
with the down beat (<i>Chan</i>) and changing weight on the upbeat (<i>chan</i>).</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><i>Chan-chan</i> to the <i>Salida
Simple</i></font></b> <br>
      <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">This is one of many
figures
contained within the left turn <i>Giro</i>, drawn on a gentle curve to
the man&#8217;s left, and executed in four moves.&nbsp; Gentlemen: lateral
move
with left leg (ONE-and), forward cross of the right leg (TWO-and),
forward
opening of left leg (THREE-and), close and weight change with right leg
(FOUR-and).</font></font> <br>
      <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Ladies: lateral move
to
her right (ONE-and), gentle passing her left leg behind her right to
his
left (TWO-and), back opening of her right leg to his left (THREE-and),
crossing her left leg in front of her right to his left (FOUR-and).</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">&nbsp;A very
common way to
change direction after the <i>Salida Simple</i> is the Tango Close or
Resolution.
The change of direction is to the man's right side, and it is executed
in three movements.</font></font> <br>
      </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">The man opens
his
left leg
forward placing his foot next to the inside of the lady's left shoe
causing
her right leg to open into the man's left side (ONE-and). The man then
opens his right leg into his right rotating his upper body to his left
and opening the lady's left leg to his right (TWO-and). The man finally
closes his left foot next to his right foot and steps in place to
change
weight, marking a similar movement for the lady (THREE-and).&nbsp;</font></font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">To complete the
four
movements,
the man can change weight in place again, or move his right leg back a
very short distance, enough to change weight (FOUR-and). The sequence <i>Salida
Simple</i>-Resolution can be repeated again. If you never heard of the
Eight Count Basic, never mind and just dance the two sequences of four
movements. Each time you open left or right, you are changing
directions,
so that at the end of four repetitions, you have completed a four
corners
type of navigation.<br>

      <p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><i>Chan-chan</i> to <i>La Base</i></font></b>
      <br>
      <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">This is another
common pattern
that combines direction changes to the left and to the right. Practice
it the same way. In <i>La Base</i>, the man avoids the fourth movement
of the <i>Salida Simple</i> (woman's cruzada) by beginning the change
of
direction to his right on what otherwise be the third movement of the <i>Salida
Simple</i>. He also skips the Resolution by backing up with his left
leg
instead of closing to change weight in place. Thus, La Base is a
continous
movement where the dancers step alternately with either leg on time
with
the rhythm.</font></font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">The man moves
to his
left
with a lateral opening of the left leg (ONE-and), then a forward cross
of the right leg (TWO-and), then a forward opening with his left leg
getting
in front of the lady (THREE-and). Pause long enough to establish a good
axis on the left leg. The man continues the back end of the base with a
lateral movement to his right (ONE-and), a back cross of the left leg
(TWO-and),
a back opening with his right leg (THREE-and). Pause long enough to
establish
a good axis on the right leg. Open out to the left with a lateral, and
repeat, using curved lateral moves to navigate changes of direction.</font></font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">The movements
in La
Base
are also complimentary and done exactly the same way by the man and the
woman, except that when one is moving forward, the other is moving
back,
and vice versa. Resist the temptation to do La Base in a square shape
to
avoid stepping twice back into the line of dance.</font></font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica" style="font-weight: bold;">Out
into the dance
floor</font><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><br>
      </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Let&#8217;s organize
now
and put
a few basic movements to the test. We'll start with a Salida simple,
followed
by a right turn Giro with Sacadas, ending the Giro with a forward Ocho
of the lady, and ending the sequence with a Resolution. Refer to the
corresponding video
frames.<br>
      <br>
      </font></font> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">We
begin the
sequence aligned
in the same fashion as when we first take to the dance floor: feet
together,
in front of each other, weight on the man's right leg and the lady's
left
leg (Frame 1).</font></font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">In Frame 2, the
man
takes
the lady to his left with a lateral opening (ONE), and in Frame 3 they
complete the transfer of weight to the man's left and the lady's right
(and).</font></font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">In Frames 4 and
5,
the man
advances with his right leg on the lady's right side as she takes a
back
step with her left foot (TWO), then they both transfer their weights to
their supporting legs (and).</font></font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">In Frame 6, the
man
begins
the marking of the cruzada by opening the lady's right leg with a
forward
opening of his left leg and a weight transfer (THREE-and).&nbsp;</font></font>
      <br>
      <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">In Frame 7 the man
closes
his right leg behind his left, bringing the lady to his left, which she
accomplishes by crossing her left leg in the direction her body is
being
sent (FOUR). Frame 8 shows the weight transfer to the man's right and
the
lady's left. Often, ladies who are taught improper technique, fail to
complete
the weight transfer to the crossed leg, skipping the "and" segment of
the
fourth step, and getting ahead of the music, compromising their balance
and posture.<br>

her three fundamental moves: a forward opening of her right leg
(ONE-and),
opening of&nbsp; her left leg (TWO-and), back cross of her right leg
(THREE-and).</font></font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">In Frame 9, as
he
marks
the first step of her giro into his right (ONE), the man stepsforward
into
her right (counter motion).&nbsp; The man displaces the lady on the
"and"
as he transfers his weight and continues turning to his right (Frame
10).
Notice how the lady responds to the sacada by holding her axis on the
leading
leg while turning as a result of the man's rotation.</font></font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">The second
movement
of the
giro continues in Frames 11 and 12. On the TWO the man marks the
lateral
opening of the lady's left leg into his right while he advances again
into
her right. On the "and" the man displaces the lady and she holds her
axis
on her left leg while turning in place while the man turns into her.
Ladies
need to remember that they always dance around the man (and the man
dances
around the room).<br>
      <br>
      </font></font> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">The
third movement
of the
giro is shown in Frame 13. The man steps and holds his axis on his left
leg (THREE) while aligned on the left side of the lady. Frame 14 shows
that on the "and" the lady transfers her weight to her left leg because
the rotation of the man in place does not allow her to finish her back
step on her right leg, but rather it provokes the quick lateral step
with
her left that brings her back into the initial body aligment of the
giro
where they are both on the right side of each other.</font></font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">For all
practical
purposes,
Frame 15 is identical to Frame 9 as far as the lady is concerned. She
can
expect the possibility of going around the man again with her three
fundamental
giro steps. For the man, because he held a step in Frame 13, he is now
"crossfeet" as he advances with his right into her right side (ONE).</font></font>
      <br>
      <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Frame 16 shows the
"and"
part of the previous step, and the resulting displacement of the lady,
who as indicated before holds her axis on her support leg. Here, the
man
holds his axis on his right leg without rotating. The right turn "giro"
has ended, and a change of direction is forthcoming.</font></font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">As the lady
received
the
displacement in Frame 15, her weight transfer provokes a complete
rotation
on her right axis as soon as the man transfers his weight to his right
leg without rotating. The anticipated change of direction takes the
form
of a forward "ocho" (Frame 17) as the lady now advances to the man's
left
side with a forward cross of her left leg (ONE). In Frame 18 the man
holds
his axis on his right leg while the lady transfers her weight to her
left
leg and rotates on her axis to face the man (and).<br>

      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">The short lived
motion to
the left of the man is altered in Frame 19 as the man readies to end
the
sequence using a standard Resolution. While sending the lady one
additional
step to his left, he advances forward with his left leg into the lady's
left side (ONE). In Frame 20, the step is completed (and) when both
transfer
their weight, man to his left, lady to her right. In Frame 21, the man
opens laterally to his right, bringing the lady also to his right
(TWO).
In Frame 22, they transfer their weight (and) aligned in front of each
other. In Frame 23 the actual closing takes place when they both change
axis in place (THREE). Frame 24 shows a typical link to the initiation
of another sequence. The man opens his left leg back enough to provoke
another weight change (FOUR), and at this point their position is
similar
to Frame 1. So after an exciting side trip to enjoy the sights, they
are
back on Main Street ready to continue their journey around the dance
floor.</font></font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">After
developing a
sense
of control over the timing of these or any sequence, put the music on!
Carlos Di Sarli is an excellent choice. He isn&#8217;t called the Lord of The
Tango for nothing. Both dancers may count aloud while they are doing
the
exercises. Try the whole Tango using only the exercises, but with the
goal
to move around the dance floor at least once. We think you will be
pleased
at how your movements will naturally correspond with the music.
Organizing
your movements in blocks of threes or fours, let&#8217;s you build your own
figures
in a controlled and rhythmic way, with navigation of the floor and
connection
to your partner as your goal.</font></font> <br>
      <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Have the discipline
to step
on the down beat (ONE), come up on axis to finish the step on the
upbeat
(without a weight change) at the &#8220;and&#8221; part of the beat. You hear so
many
clich&eacute;s about how to walk the tango. &#8220;It&#8217;s like a heart beat&#8221;.
&#8220;It&#8217;s
like breathing&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s the chan-chan.&#8221; Whatever it takes to stop you
from
running like a Tasmanian Devil or Woody Woodpecker on skates on every
beat. (Just forget &#8220;walking
like
a cat&#8221;, unless you want to get down on all fours).</font></font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Exhale as you
put
your foot
down (the first contact with front of the foot, the ball, the
metatarsal,
edge of little toe when you go forward, edge of big toe when you step
lateral
or back, arrive flat on the ground with the heel down, knee softened).
Inhale as you arrive up on the step, on axis (when you are &#8220;up on the
step&#8221;,
or &#8220;over the step&#8221;, at this point completely on axis on the support
leg,
cast your eyes downand -&nbsp; you should not see your foot). The free
leg naturally closes to &#8220;finish the step&#8221; as a result of coming up on
the
step with both knees straightened. The effect of the counted movement
of
the walk is, One-and. Or Chan-chan. Or Bomp-bomp (or whatever the sound
is that the heart beats in your imagination). Breathe, but don&#8217;t overdo
it and hyperventilate. This explanation and exercise take place
naturally
and simultaneously and seamlessly, the several parts of each step
imperceptible
to the onlooker, except that you move with the cadencia of the Tango.
All
the steps we dance are &#8220;walks&#8221;. However, as we should now know, it is
NOT
like walking in the street in our normal way. We are dancing the
&#8220;walks&#8221;,
by changing axis with each step.</font></font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As the music changes...</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Juan D&#8217;Arienzo is
playing.
It&#8217;s rocking. In fact it&#8217;s swingin&#8217;! Again he is not known as The King
of The Beat for nothing. You can still dance the entire tango stepping
only on the downbeat, but because of the tempo of this orchestra, it is
natural to feel inclined to also step on the upbeat, to step on the
&#8220;and."</font></font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">D&#8217;Arienzo is
also
credited
with speeding up the old 2X4 Tango rythmn of the 1890&#8217;s, to a modern
interpetation
of the 1930&#8217;s and onward. 2X4 has nothing to do with a piece of wood
(or
dancing like one).This time the measure is only four beats, with counts
of ONE-and, TWO-and. So you can make your life even easier when
using&nbsp;
the 2X4 tempo, because you never need count above two!<br>
      <br>
      </font></font> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">When
dancing to
D'Arienzo
or Biagi, it is very popular among milongueros to end the Salida Simple
on the upbeat rather than the downbeat. That is, the lady is made to
cross
on the "and" of the third step, rather than on the fourth step. So the
salida simple would be counted, ONE-and, TWO-and, ONE-and where the
third
"and" is used to actually change weight to the other leg, rather than
holding
it as in a regular "and."</font></font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">The Tango Close
or
Resolution
is also ended on the upbeat rather than the downbeat. You can count it
like this: ONE-and, TWO-and, where the second "and" is used to actually
change weight to the other leg, rather than holding it as on a regular
"and."</font></font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Stepping on the
"and" is
called a "traspie," a "quick," a "sobrepaso," and even a "syncopation."
or&nbsp; &#8220;bomp, bomp, bomp.&#8221; As you can see the lady can also double
step,
by accident or design without ever again having to apologize for her
"mistake!"
It is desirable that the man always mark the stepping on the "and," but
it is even more important that he be aware of an "unmarked" double step
by the lady.</font></font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">The result of
an
unmatched
doublestep by either one of the dancers, is to change the moton of
their
legs from a parallel sequence to a cross feet sequence, or viceversa.
Working
around these conditions is at the heart of tango improvisation.</font></font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">It would be
exhausting,
and perhaps a visual overkill to double step every beat, so keep in
mind
that dancing is not racing to hit the floor on every beat. Mix up
stepping
on the one, the downbeat, and mixing it up with stepping on the
upbeats,
the &#8220;ands&#8221;. Why it isn&#8217;t counted as a triple step for the man, is
because
as he steps one, two, three, he steps twice with the same foot, hence
double
stepping.<br>
      <br>
      </font></font> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">In
ballroom
parlance, the
rhythm would go slow, slow, quick quick, slow quick quick, slow. Again
practice first while listening to the music counting aloud (or banging
the steering wheel or the top of your desk) in groups of threes and
fours.
Count aloud while you practice to dance with the music. Or chant &#8220;bomp
bomp, bomp&#8221; or &#8220;quick quick, slow&#8221; or &#8220;Larry, Moe, Curly&#8221; . What
verbalization
you use to get&nbsp; your body moving is semantic. But get your body
moving!</font></font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Double stepping
can
be done
to the tempo of any tango, vals or milonga (besides D&#8217;Arienzo) -
Di Sarli,
Tanturi, Biaggi, De Angelis, Calo, Troilo, Canaro, Rodriguez, Varela,
Pugliese
- just let the music speak to you.</font></font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Let the music speak for you...</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Remember that we
are phrasing
the tango, much in the way we naturally speak with implied punctuation
using the idea of commas and semi colons and periods, as a way to
breathe
and organize verbalized thoughts. Since we don&#8217;t have an orchestra
playing
when we speak, dictating the tempo in which we speak, we can speak in
any
time signature that is comfortable or expressive. But with dance, the
music
dictates how we express our bodies with rhythmic thought. No two
dancers
will ever interpret the music in the same way, but the music must be
used
to speak for you and your partner, and further, for those looking on,
especially
if it is a live orchestra playing for dancers (yes musicians do watch,
and when the dancers are dancing the music, they feed into your dancing
as you feed into their music).</font></font> <br>
