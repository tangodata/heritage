      <td>We are reaching a point where the original purpose of this
series is being fulfilled. More and more people realize that there is
more
to dancing tango than arguing about styles, proclaiming who is the best
teacher this week, or pretending a level of expertise from behind the
glare
of a computer screen.<br>
      <br>
The way people dance is affected by social and cultural values. People
in different countries dance differently in social clubs, salons and
night
clubs. One thing is common everywhere where tango is danced: couples
are
required to embrace. By definition, embracing involves arms surrounding
one another with neither pelvis pushing in nor butt sticking out. Yet,
people fight over "open" and "close" embrace as they draw battle lines
to protect the "purity" of their turf.<br>
      <br>
A similar situation occurs in the matter of styles of dancing. Nowhere
in Europe, Canada, and of course Argentina, you will find discussions,
dissertations and grand standings on "invented" style names. It's only
in communities in this country that people find the need to give
everything
a name, embellishing it with the use of an euphemism here and an
oxymoron
there.<br>
      <br>
At the end of the day, there is only one way to dance tango: the way
YOU
like to dance it. And there is only one style: the one YOU choose to be
your style;
because a tango dancer never copies, never imitates, never conforms to
an established pattern, never follows the trends, never talks about his
dancing. A tango dancer dances.<br>
      <br>
What and when does a tango dancer dance? Whatever and whenever the
moment, the music, and the partner provide the ingredients that
motivates
a dancer to dance.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Variations on Giros to the left <br>
      <br>
      </span>As teachers, we try to encourage dancers to dance, whether
in a class
environment, or through the sharing of our experience in this series of
articles.<br>
      <br>
The description of figures captured on video during live teaching
sessions
and performances, is primarily aimed to frame their execution from the
mindset of the man and the woman during the process of sheer
improvisation.<br>
      <br>
In this issue's example, we will analyze the interruption of a right
hand giro with a change of direction that initiates a left hand giro.
During
the progression of the left hand turn, the man will advance breaking
the
line on which the woman is executing her change of front, displacing
her
into a new trajectory where both dancers will turn around each other
changing
fronts. The movement will be interrupted by a change of direction to
the
right, whereby the dancers will find themselves in the same initial
position
from where they will repeat the left hand turn again, to finally exit
with
a salida cruzada on their way to their next destination. The movement
will
begin at the end end of a salida simple, which&nbsp; is one of many
positions
where a new trajectory can be initiated.<br>
      <br>
First take notice that both the man and the woman are in an almost
identical position as that adopted at the beginning of a salida. The
man's
axis is on his right leg, the woman's axis is on her left leg (Frame
1).
The woman's right leg is hooked (crossed) behind the left, rather than
next to it as it is at the salida. The position may look and feel
different,
but it is exactly equivalent to the beginning of a salida.<br>
      <br>
With the woman's right leg crossed behind the left, it is more obvious
that she can be made to pivot to her left and made to walk forward into
the man's right side. The man marks her pivot with a rotation of his
upper
body, and her forward step with a matching left back step of his own
(Frame
2).<br>
      <br>
The man stops with his weight on his left leg, marking a pivot for
the woman in order to change directions. Rather than continuing moving
into his right side, her body now is positioned to walk again forward,
but in the direction of the man's left thus initiating a giro to the
left.
The man accompanies her forward step to his left by turning to his left
on his left leg while letting his right leg coil around the rotating
axis
completely weightless. (Frame 3).<br>
      <br>
The impulse of the man's rotation on his left axis, marks a second
step for the woman, who then begins to change her front with forward
opening
of her left leg in order to continue her giro around the man. As she
touches
the ground with her right leg, the man initiates a forward step into
her
left side crossing the line between her open legs and preparing to
displace
her left leg (sacada) as soon as his weight is transferred (Frame 4). <br>

      <p>It is important to emphasize that the man must continue
rotating throughout
the entire figure to create the trajectory on which she will execute
her
changes of front around him. Also, it is very important for the man to
tuck his left arm and to open his left shoulder turning his upper torso
deeply into his left side, in order to avoid sending the woman away
from
him when she is in the reverse step of her change of front.</p>
      <p>It is also very important for the woman to allow her right
elbow to
bend so she can actually be pulled deeply into the left side of the
man.
A very common occurrence is the stiff arm syndrome which has kept many
women from ever knowing that there is left side to every man. At a more
basic level, the stiff arm syndrome is what stops a woman from
finishing
the salida in the correct body position, because she stops herself from
being able to cross her left leg over her right leg and end up in front
of the man.</p>
      <p>With the man moving forward into the woman's left side with a
displacement,
the woman receives the sacada by pivoting on her right leg. The man
follows
with his left leg the woman's left leg as she pivots, and marks the end
of her change of front by stepping on the inside of her right foot
while
she steps back with her left leg. (Frame 5).</p>
      <p>The man continues rotating to his left while transferring his
weight,
and the impulse completes the woman's back step with a quick opening of
her right leg which places her again on his left side (Frame 6).</p>
      <p>While rotating on his left axis, the man marks with his body
her next
movement, which happens to be the beginning of a new change of front,
or
if you prefer to see it in a different way, the beginning of a new giro
to the left. The man must time the landing of his opening right with
the
landing of her forward left leg (Frame 7). Depending on the amount of
rotation,
the man has the choice to straddle with the opening of his legs the
woman's
forward step, or to advance his right leg into the woman's left side
producing
a bonus sacada in the process. <br>

While in the open position, the man simply does a half a turn in place
ending the left progression of the woman's giro. Since she is
on her left axis, the body mark of the man provokes a pivot on her left
leg. This changes the direction of her movement, and she returns into
the
man ready to begin a change of front into the man's right side (Frame
8).</p>
      <p>The next move is identical to Frame 2, with the man marking a
forward
step to his right, while accompanying with a back step of his own
(Frame 9).</p>
      <p>Here is where the mind of the creative dancer recognizes the
position
and seizes the opportunity to repeat the figure just finished, albeit
that
he is already planning to end it in a different way. On Frame 10 the
man
interrupts the forward motion of the woman into his right by stopping
and
setting his axis on his left leg. As he continues to turn to his left,
Frame 11 is identical to Frame 3 and Frame 12 is identical to Frame 4
as
the woman advances through the first two steps of her change of front.</p>
      <p>Anticipating the third move of her change of front (going
backwards),
the man does a half a turn in place to position himself on her right
side,
cross feet position as she steps back with her left leg (Frame 13).</p>
      <p>Recognizing that this is the second move of a salida cruzada,
the man
can continue forward to complete the salida cruzada, for example,
whereby
the sequence comes to an end. The opportunity to initiate another
combination
waits for the creative dancers in their displacement around la ronda
embroidering
the dance floor with their invisible curved lines.<br>
