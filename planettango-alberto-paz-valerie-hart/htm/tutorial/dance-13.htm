<td BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF"><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Have you
had non-Tango dancing family members ask you about the rose between the
teeth and the dips to the floor? This questioning comes across the noisy
clatter at the dinner table, after the eating and drinking have eased the
minds for a family heart to heart conversation. With the acquired sufficiency
that being a Tango dancer brings about in all of us, we go into the dissertation
about Tango being an urban dance with uncertain origins, associated with
the worst elements of Buenos Aires society and witness to the burgeoning
prostitution business that flourished in the city throughout the nineteenth
century and the first decade of this century. This part gets the giggling
attention of the young males. <i>You mean I have to pay a woman to dance?</i>
No, you just have to pay attention to a woman.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>By the time the story gets
to the part when the last vestiges of brothel stench dissipated with the
winds of time, and Tango became a dance of connection between men and women,
a dance of sublimated sexuality, the females sit up straight. When we get
to the explanation of the roles of men and women, as it has been practiced
in Buenos Aires for years, most of the questions are directed to the American
half of our partnership.</font></font>

<h2>
<b>We all like to dance with "good" dancers.</b></h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Whether it is a God given right
or a matter of selfishness, it is important to empower women with the knowledge
that is required to be great Argentine Tango dancers. The odds are heavily
against them as the ratio of male to female teachers follow the old formula
of men being the masters and the ladies their partners. Rather than succumbing
to the politically correct notion that men should allow themselves to look
silly by pretending to dance like a woman, men need to understand that
the joy of Tango dancing for a woman demands of them a complex and sometimes
paradoxical series of qualities. A woman can make a man look and feel mighty
good. And it is also a joy when a man can make a woman feel like a creature
of consummate grace, beauty, strength and skill.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The structure of our society
has been very unfair to women, injustices and bad deeds still abound and
it is a jungle out there. Men and women are pitted against each other at
work, at home, at school, etc., in a war of genders. Women have fought
and have made great progress to further their careers, their feminism and
their individuality. So suddenly Argentine Tango comes to America with
farfetched ideas of women voluntarily letting go, responding instantaneously
to the subtle or forceful marking of motion of their male partners, while
skillfully maneuvering the dance floor at high speed, backwards and in
high heels. Further, there is this division of labor where men assume the
responsibility for choosing, shaping and directing the movements of the
dance across a crowded dance floor. To make things peachy, some like to
desensitize the gender issue with the euphemism “follow” to describe a
woman they are dancing with.</font></font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>So, how does this concept
of role playing by men and women, who dance Tango in the traditional Buenos
Aires fashion, play in dining rooms across the USA?. The answer is, not
too well. Quite often one forgets that entering a milonga does not mean
leaving the real world. Yet, there is so much delusion among many grown
ups, that the minute they step on the dance floor they assume false identities
and proceed to act like fools.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In our society very little
is taken for granted when it comes to gender definition. After the initial
years of learning Tango as followers connecting dots, or by delusional
imitation of ballroom dancers’ skillful imitation of show dancers, women
who manage not to fall down during an entire evening (whether on their
own or hanging from their partners) decide they want to lead, to sit in
the driver’s seat, to go for the gusto, to experience the “fun” part of
Tango dancing. False pretensions don’t have a place on the dance floor,
because one cannot dance Tango alone. For the single most appealing aspect
of the Argentine Tango is the unspoken expression of a way of life by those
who embrace to dance, each contributing to enhance the sense of self and
freedom for the other. This does not simply happen by just leading and
following.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>As more and more women begin
to receive the quality instruction they deserve, and as more and more women
realize that they have been treated as second class citizens by the studios,
associations and societies that cater to the hedonistic appetites of many
of their choice of visiting teachers, a growing population of technically
fit dancers are gradually enhancing the quality of our dance halls, rivaling
in many cases and sometimes surpassing the skills and talents of many native
females who frequent the dance halls of Buenos Aires.</font></font>
<h2>
Lessons for a life of Tango</h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Writing about her film The Tango
Lesson, Sally Potter attempts to demystify the complexity and paradoxical
demands that are placed upon female dancers. There is no disclaimer, but
later on she writes about her classes with Juan Carlos Copez (sic) and
Graziella (sic).</font></font>
<h4>
A woman must be completely centered and balanced so she can be able to
move at an instant’s notice in any direction.</h4>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>True, but the same applies to
the male dancer since the only way he is going to be able to know where
he is going is to make sure he knows where he is, ergo centered and balanced.
Sally leaves out the boring part, the how to fill symbolism with substance.
Being centered and balanced requires that the entire body weight be supported
by the metatarsus of your support foot, the one you just put down to push
the floor with in order to be grounded before you elongate and make yourself
tall on that leg.</font></font>
<h4>
She must be in complete control of her body in order to surrender control
of where she is going.</h4>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>True, but being in control of
your body really means trusting your body, following your body and of course
trusting your partner. This is a thorny issue because you can't close your
eyes and pretend, well, yes you can, but then what is the purpose of reading
this? You need to see where you are going.</font></font>
<h4>
She needs to be completely grounded so she can be free enough to feel that
she is flying.</h4>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>One of the first things we were
made aware when we first started studying with Mingo Pugliese was that
we were "flying." The displacement of Tango dancers is aimed down to the
floor rather than up into the air. So as a corollary of the centered and
balanced issue, a person who's centered and balanced and grounded can move
as if rolling on precision ball bearings.</font></font>
<h4>
Her body must be toned enough to provide enough resistance to the man to
respond to his proposed changes of direction in a completely relaxed way
that avoids obstruction.</h4>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>True, but think about the telephone.
Tone is not as important as the connection that allows the parties to communicate.
The most misunderstood element of Tango dancing is the embrace. This is
what the dictionary says about the embrace: a close encircling with the
arms and pressure to the bosom, the bosom being the front of the human
chest, the female breasts, the anatomical center of secrets and emotions.
That's why the fad called "close embrace" is an oxymoron. Of course you
also have heard about "open embrace" but let's get back to the point.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>When a man and a woman embrace
to dance Tango, they are contributing 100% of each other to the centering
and balance of the couple by first being centered and balanced on their
own. So, it is incorrect to ask a woman to provide resistance while in
the next breath we ask them to surrender control, to do nothing, etc. As
a matter of fact the whole grocery list of requests is incorrect. Both
the man and the woman must commit to the embrace which is where they will
dance. As the man marks, the dynamics and shape of the space defined by
the embrace changes to allow the woman to dance into the space while maintaining
the integrity of the embrace. In case it is not obvious, the interaction
takes place by the alignment of the upper bodies in the embrace and their
motion in space to the rhythm and melody of the music.</font></font>
<h4>
The woman must be mentally alert in order to keep her mind empty in the
present time in order to respond at the speed and with the precision that
it is required.</h4>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Right! Tell the CEO of the hottest
software company, out for some relaxing Tango dancing, to empty her mind.
You've come a long way babe, now shut up and follow.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>When we dance, in spite of
the fact that we do this quite often for fun and while working, our minds
are sharp as surgical blades tuned to the music, to the space surrounding
us, to the alignment of our bodies and to everything that is needed to
be centered, balanced and comfortable in the embrace. Like the crew of
a jumbo jet, each of us runs an almost unconscious check list which has
been internalized, and still is, with hours and hours of practice, miles
of dance floor and a constant inquisitive mind for studying and trying.
As a result we are in a constant improvisational mode dictated by our partner,
our mood, the conditions of the dance floor and the choice of music.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The successful results we
obtain whenever we approach a class, a workshop or an exhibition, are the
consequence of having first seriously studied with a qualified master,
i.e. Mingo Pugliese, and second of having opened our minds to self and
mutual critical analysis, to having accepted the long hours of practice
and frustrations, and above all for having agreed from day one to treat
our Tango dancing and teaching as a very important aspect of our lives.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In practical terms, we suggest
that women take care of controlling their bodies always reaching for balance
at the end of every step, while we teach men how to create motion by offsetting
that balance. It is during the positions of balance that the orientation
of the bodies can be changed through pivots or rotations over the supporting
leg, before motion in the new direction begins. Thus, the woman's legs
always open, in the direction her body is moving in to reach to a new position
of balance. Then the legs close in a relaxed way to achieve balance. Maintaining
a firm and comfortable embrace insures that the connection between the
dancers is conducive to smooth displacements and sheer improvisation since
both bodies move in unison carried by the legs that provide support and
transportation.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In Argentine Tango, the legs
provide support and allow the bodies to dance within the embrace. Leg dancing
can be detrimental to the development of individuals attempting to dance
Tango.</font></font></td>
