<td BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF"><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>One of
the main resources for Tango dancers is the large number of videos available
from various sources. Given enough time and patience, most people could
eventually copy and replicate some of the breathtaking moves we see in
those videos. However, the majority of reputable experts, some of which
make a good living dancing for the cameras, will tell you that nobody has
ever learned to dance Tango from a video. A video should be a tool similar
to the notebook or handbook we used at school, its purpose being to refresh
in our minds concepts learned in class, to observe the correct demonstration
of an exercise or a sequence of steps and to be a reference source for
consultation.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Videos used to watch other
people dance are very popular and people insist on buying them with the
hope that the magic annointment will come to them by some sort of esoteric
transfer from the screen to their bodies. The one and only video we all
can certainly use is missing most of the time from our videotheque. It
is the video where we see ourselves dance. Reality check they call it,
because as we spend a lot of time watching and attempting to imitate visually,
we fail to see ourselves and therefore we can’t firgure out why some things
are just so difficult to accomplish. Or even worse, we dance our way to
the milongas with the wrong opinion about ourselves.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>One of the end results is
the large number of men who blame their partners for their obvious lack
of balance and the inability to execute the way the video demonstrated.</font></font>
<p><font size=+1>The Posture</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>At the opening session of
the last Stanford Tango Week, young master Pablo Pugliese began his five
days of classes by saying “the Tango begins with the posture and it ends
in the legs.” Then he proceeded to enumerate several principles which we
have heard from various masters as well.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Each dancer must find his
and her axis and each must be capable to move without throwing the other
out of balance. Simple, yet hard to implement.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>There is a visual illusion
that makes us believe that the execution of figures and patterns are always
done with the body weight on the opposite leg than it actually takes place.
Unless we understand the dynamics of the embrace, and how torso, arms and
shoulder interact, we run the risk of imitating what we see in the videos
placing our body weights on the wrong side of the figure.</font></font>
<p><b>The Dynamics of the Embrace</b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The Argentine Tango dance
requires that men and women embrace and move around in unison.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The embrace symbolizes the
union of two partners determined to care for each other while enjoying
the moment, the music, the floor, the surrounding dancers and each other’s
company. The contact makes for pleasant sensations but most important,
it provides the means for the transmission of signals that are needed for
safe navigation on the dance floor and smooth execution of the dance.</font></font>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../images/posture.gif" HSPACE=10 WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="289" ALIGN="Left" NOSAVE><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>To
begin with, both dancers start by standing in front of each other about
a foot apart. As they ready to assume the embrace, their body weight gets
transferred to the metatarsus area of the foot, commonly known as the ball
of the foot or the base of the toes. This produces a natural lean so the
upper bodies can come into contact at the chest area.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The right arm of the man
is locked at the shoulder as he surrounds the woman’s back by placing his
right hand with closed fingers on her left shoulder blade. The woman rests
the upper part of her left arm on the upper part of the man’s right arm
so she can feel the mark produced by the moving action of his right arm
and shoulder. Her left hand should rest softly on the man’s shoulder but
it should not exert any kind on pressure or be used for balance or leverage
because this will inhibit his freedom of movement and it could contribute
to throw him out of balance.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The final link to complete
the embrace is the man’s left arm which extends straight out from his shoulder
with the elbow bent at about a ninety degree angle. His hand opens in such
a way that the woman can make palm to palm contact. His fingers close gently
to hold her right hand in place. Both man and woman’s shoulders should
be locked so there is no separate motion from the body and the arms.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>If the embrace is approached
in this fashion, any subtle motion of the man’s upper body will be felt
very clearly by the woman, and her upper body will move accordingly. Since
feet follow the body, a dynamic interaction of the upper bodies result
in a visually pleasant and smooth displacement of the dancing couple.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>During the dance, the woman
always walks forward or backwards on a straight line, meaning that her
leading leg should always move in the direction her body is facing. It
follows that to turn, the body must change direction first (using the pivot
or swivel of the supporting leg) before the leg moves in a straight line
in the new direction.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The man walks with the woman
always in front of him, whether he moves to her right or to her left. This
is very important to understand. The woman must walk in a straight line.
The man can then walk straight in front of her, to her right or to her
left.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Having said that, walking
for both men and women means adopting a posture that will be both comfortable
and elegant. Because of the natural lean adopted at the beginning of the
dance, the man will always move with his upper body first followed by his
legs attempting always to keep his body weight in the middle not favoring
either leg. This concept is important as many already know one the most
basics figures of the Tango: the parada followed by the sandwich.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Deficient teaching techniques
ask the dancers to “sit” on the support leg making it impossible for that
leg to respond on cue. Here is where learning by watching, as popular as
it is, is misleading. Argentine Tango is a dance of fluidity and continuity.
A man can stop the woman (parada), sandwich her foot, and immediately mark
a boleo. The woman cannot respond if her support leg is nailed to the ground
with her entire body weight on it. Had she been in the middle, she could
boleo and continue dancing without breaking the continuity and progression
of the dance.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>So posture is important and
leads to good balance. The lack thereof is the main reason why we have
so many problems replicating what we see on video or putting into practice
the mass of knowledge some have accumulated over the years.</font></font>
<p><b>Dancing into the embrace</b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>When the woman is properly
embraced by the man, the contact that she feels enables her to dance or
move "into" the man’s right arm when taking a back step. The woman should
attempt to keep contact with the man’s arm while walking back, and especially
on the back step of the giro where it is necessary to generate a centrifugal
force. It is very important that the man also keeps contact and a connection
that can be clearly felt by the woman. When the woman is turning to her
right she dances into the direction of her own arm. As the man is turning,
he opens his left shoulder a bit, making the space for her to dance into.</font></font></td>
