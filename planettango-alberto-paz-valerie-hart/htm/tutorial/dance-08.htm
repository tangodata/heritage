Tango dancing is about a couple moving around the dance floor led by the
rhythm and melody of the music. Navigating the floor is an acquired skill
and it combines timing, balance and talent to improvise.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>We have been leaning on more
and more towards the improvisational aspect of the Tango dance because
it removes the shackles which the dreaded eight count basic places on legs
and arms of beginning dancers. Dancing Tango is about freedom to express
with our bodies and our hearts the very special feelings that each and
every Tango induces in us.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In those moments when the
rhythm of the orchestra, the moaning of the bandoneon, the solemnity of
the violin or the voice of the singer enraptures our bodies and soul, we
could hardly be remembering StepPatternNumber954B, or trying to apply VariationNumber173A
which Joe Blow, or was it Peter Woodlimbs, showed the last time before
the milonga.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>This is where the power of
improvisation comes in handy. To be able to do so, we must be able to have
the elements and the knowledge to identify familiar body positions so we
can invent on the spur of the moment a way to move to another position
without missing a beat.</font></font>
<p><b><font size=+1>Where there is motion</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>There should also be stillness,
and this month's topic is just that, stillness, pausing, or more specifically
what is commonly known as parada, a stop in the progression of the dancers's
motion.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>If you've been following
this series of notes, you are familiar with the Eight Movement Turn, or
as it is also called, a Giro de Ocho. Briefly, an EMT is a series of continous
turns that can be executed to the right or to the left in eight body movements.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Knowing how to initiate,
enter, stop or exit from a Giro gives the dancer a powerful tool to develop
creative improvisational skills.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Imagine that you are in front
of eight different doors, each numbered from 1 to 8, and further, that
there is a requirement that you enter the odd numbered doors with your
left foot and the even numbered doors with your right foot.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>We omit addressing specifically
men and women because this concept is equally important for both dancers,
and although 99% of the time the men are the ones who are taught how to
use Giros for a variety of patterns, there is no reason why women can't
enter and exit Giros as well, assuming that (a) they understand the concept,
and (b) that the men they are dancing with, know how to mark the steps.</font></font>
<p><b><font size=+1>Introduction to the Parada</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In this particular exercise,
we will begin the Giro at the Cruzada point, that is at the end of the
Salida, when the bodies are aligned in front of each other occupying one
lane, feet are together but crossed. (Figure 1)</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>First, he needs to unlock
her crossed feet by slightly opening his upper torso to his left. This
will induce a rotation of her upper body over her left foot. Next, using
his right arm to create the space where she will move and rotating his
upper body to his right over his right foot, he marks a forward step in
the new direction her body is facing. As she steps forward, there is Door
Number 1 so he "enters" with his left foot. (Figure 2). As he steps forward,
he displaces her left foot (he produces a Sacada) as he transfers her weight
completely to her right foot.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>He continues rotating his
upper body to his right creating a new space with his right arm for her
to pivot changing direction opening her left leg to her side. This is Door
Number 2 so he now "enters" with his right foot and produces another Sacada
when he transfers her weight to her left leg. (Figure 3)</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Next, he opens his right
shoulder to create space for her so she can step back with her right foot
after pivoting on her left foot. As she moves, he moves rotating his upper
body to his right and bringing his left foot at a right angle to her pivoting
left foot. This is Door Number 3, but a decision is made not to "enter".
So he locks his right shoulder, places his hand firmly on her back, and
stops his rotation. She responds to this lack of space to move by not moving,
so the dancers are now in what is called a Parada. (Figure 4)</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>This is one of many simple
examples of how to use acquired knowledge to modify set patterns, to alter
a movement, to make a decision on the spot and to continue dancing with
flair, fluidity, grace, elegance and poise. Improvisation is what leads
to fancy dancing on a crowded floor.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>We will continue next time,
but in the meantime see if you can improvise your next step trying not
to forget which foot you both stepped with last and how are your bodies
aligned at this point. Who said that homework was not any fun?</font></font></td>
