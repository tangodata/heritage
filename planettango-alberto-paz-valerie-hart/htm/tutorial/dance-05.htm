<td BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF"><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Previously,
we have attempted to provide a series of concepts that include basic elements
and fundamental propositions that can serve as the starting point of a
dancing learning experience. There is an entire set of intangibles that
is very difficult to categorize, assemble and compact into a series of
lessons. Feelings, emotions, intimacy, sensuality, are among the most talked
about yet most difficult intangibles to define and implement that are part
of the whole Tango dancing experience.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>There are plenty of quotes
to choose from in order to qualify our dancing. As with most quotes, they
become clich&eacute;s the minute we attempt to make them part of our paradigm.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><b>Enrique Santos Discepolo</b>
(1901-1951) is credited with the most quoted expression about the Tango:
<i>It
is a sad thought that you can dance</i>. Years later, a Midwest columnist
coined: <i>It is the vertical expression of a horizontal desire</i>. There
is no concrete evidence that either
<b>Discepolo</b> or the Midwest columnist
ever danced a Tango.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The former was concerned
about the symbolic value of the nostalgia felt by a suburban popular culture
that witnessed the loss of its traditional values to the massive invasion
of foreign ideologies.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The latter saw to it that
people's morbid curiosity would draw them to the box office. Unfortunately
some of them also made it to the dance floor.</font></font>
<h3>
A historical perspective</h3>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Actually, anybody interested
in history can find out that people interested in Tango dancing have been
drawn to it because of the certainty of finding enjoyment, pleasure, self-gratification
and happiness during the course of its practice. If history is not your
strength, a trip down to South America, to the city of Buenos Aires and
into just about any place where Tango is danced, will allow you to see
hundreds of people having unadulterated fun. As you enter a dance hall,
the lights, the people, the music, the dancing, scream aloud, <u>it's party
time, let's have some fun, have a great evening!</u> This is the Tango
we call our dance.</font></font>
<h3>
The line of dance that Tango invites us to join</h3>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><b>Susana Miller</b>, an outspoken
teacher who travels extensively throughout the United States and Europe,
has been quoted to say that to understand Tango, one must understand the
fundamentals. This can be seen clearly in the body, movement, circulation
on the dance floor and musicality of the great dancers. Great dancers are
creative, each dances his own distinct Tango but the fundamentals stay
the same in all of them, she continues, then adding, the dance must be
rooted in these fundamentals before it can be personal... <i>when one doesn't
understand the essence, it is replaced by clich&eacute;s, which are a parody
of the dance</i>.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In general, our own observation
and many hours of intimate conversations with some of the most distinguished
teachers and performers from Buenos Aires, confirm our belief that the
Argentine Tango is a popular <i>porte&ntilde;o</i> cultural expression
that has its own style, pauses, musicality, body language and space management
on the dance floor. All of this is inspired by the music that invites us
to dance.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The superabundance of traveling
teachers has created a distorted culture of confusion where collecting
information and trading on steps and figures has delayed the learning process
of most communities. Add to that the fixation with performance that seems
to pervade at the core of most communities and you can understand why Tango
has become a commercial way out of Buenos Aires for many who honestly feel
they can offer obsessed Tango step collectors yet another option to gloat
and one more luxury object to collect.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Ironically, a current historic
revisionism indicates that the genesis of the Tango dance was a form of
expression for a hybrid population marginated to the outskirts of the city
and frustrated by their lack of consumer power of acquisition. Creating
dreams from nothing is a lesson that those born along the shores of the
River Plate have learned from their immigrant ancestors. When the Tango
music plays, we take onto the dance floor a desire to create dreams from
nothing but our brains, our ears, our hearts, our legs and another human
being whom we hold dearly close with an embrace.</font></font>
<h3>
Becoming part of la ronda</h3>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Once we step onto <i>la pista</i>,
we become part of <i>la ronda</i>, we belong to a conglomerate of expressions
and we form part of a collective demonstration of skills and social manners.
Understanding the core elements of the dance, the fundamentals, allows
us to assume responsibility for our behavior as it relates to our partner,
to our fellows dancers and to the dance floor itself.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>What kind of music is Mr.
DJ playing now? Listening to the music should be the first priority for
the dancer, including sitting out an inappropriate choice by Mr. DJ. The
risk in many of our North American communities is to sit out most of the
night! So, make some allowances.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The milonga is not the place
to experiment with the music nor it is the place to experiment with choreography
that requires a lot more space than is available on a social dance floor.
We have become somehow oblivious to the leg and foot injuries suffered
on the dance floors where the lack of leadership and professional ethics
of the hosts encourage reckless behavior in return for a cover charge.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>A responsible host will make
time available to showcase those who have "performance fever" by interrupting
the dance for about five minutes to let an exhibition take place.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Let's make it clear. Getting
injured by careless and insensitive dancers does not go with the territory.
First we must take care of our partner by not engaging in dangerous behavior
ourselves. That means sharing the dancing space without hogging the space
to practice the latest shtick.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Second, we must make sure
that our dance is an extension of the music being played and that it is
communicated in a respectfully intimate way between partners and that we
use the fundamentals to make decisions as to when to walk, when to turn,
when to pause, when to do a figure and how to mix and manage these elements
to make our dance a joyful experience.</font></font>
<h3>
The Change of Front pattern</h3>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>One pattern we found very useful
to circulate along the line of dance while incorporating turns and forward
and back <i>ochos</i>, is the change of front. It can be initiated from
many different looks but from the same body position when the feet are
together and the bodies are fully frontal to each other. The beginning
of the dance and the <i>cruzada</i> are two very distinctive looks where
the change of front can be initiated. Another possibility is during a forward
walk where the bodies are also in what we like to call <b>Body Position
1</b> (BP-1), i.e. fully facing each other.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>A change of front for the
man is accomplished in three steps, a forward, a side and a back step.
We'll see later that these three steps are the basis for the execution
of <i>giros</i> for the ladies. But for now let's look at it first from
the man's perspective.</font></font>

a back&nbsp;</font>
<br><font size=-1>step (2a) and steps together with her with his left foot
(2b).</font>
<br><font size=-1>His left arm extends to his left while holding her body
with</font>
<br><font size=-1>his right arm so she will pivot on her right foot. As
he steps</font>
<br><font size=-1>with his left, he pivots to his left and opens her to
her left</font>
<br><font size=-1>(3a). He then opens his right to face her (3b). Next
he shifts</font>
<br><font size=-1>his weight to his right to mark a body weight change
to her</font>
<br><font size=-1>left foot. He pivots on his right foot, opens to his
left, makes</font>
<br><font size=-1>her pivot to her left and step forward with her right
(4a) while<br>
he extends his left foot back to stay ahead of her (4b).</font></td>

</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The purpose is
to advance one step in the forward direction while placing the left foot
slightly pointing to the left (10 o'clock). Next, the body naturally begins
to turn to the left because of the left foot is already pointing in that
direction. To complete the second step, the right foot travels in an arc
to produce a side step allowing the body to be fully facing left from the
initial position. On the third beat, as the body weight transfer to the
right foot, the upper body opens so there is a pivoting effect on the axis
of the right foot. The left foot collects while turning and as the body
now faces away from the line of dance, the left leg extends in a back step
allowing the metatarsus to provide solid support of the body as it makescontact
with the floor. A change of front has occurred. Meanwhile, the lady begins
the change of front noticing a different mark. Her partner's body moves
closer on the first step as he points his left foot to his left. Her first
back step then is marked to her right rather than straight back.&nbsp;</font></font></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>As the man turns his body
on the second step, she notices the mark to open to her left by executing
a side step with her left foot. They are now both at a right angle form
the initial position, still in BP-1, facing each fully frontal. As the
man begins the third step, she will notice that his right arm limits the
amount of forward displacement that she can travel on her third step, as
she turns on her left foot and steps forward with her right one. At this
point, the man has changed front from being "behind" the lady when he faced
the line of dance, to being "ahead" of the lady when he faces away from
the line of dance. Also their bodies are offset to one side, no longer
fully frontal to each other. Only the right half of his torso is facing
the right half of her torso. They are occupying twice as much space across
the line of dance. This is what we would like to call <b>Body Position
2</b> (BP-2). The leg placement is identical to the second step of the
salida to the <i>cruzada</i> movement explained in an earlier installment.
Recognizing these familiar "looks" is a major step towards honing your
improvisation skills.</font></font></td>
