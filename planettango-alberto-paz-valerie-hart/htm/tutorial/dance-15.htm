<td BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF"><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Whether
you are dancing with your partner on a crowded or an empty room, understanding
the reason and the logic of most Tango moves helps to develop an instinct
for floor navigation with finesse. The only space that really counts, and
the one for which both partners are equally responsible, is the space occupied
by the embrace. Take good care of the embrace and the Tango will take care
of itself.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>What differentiates the creativity
and expression of an enjoyable dance from plain empty geometry are the
underlying factors that contributed to create many of the figures and patterns
available to dancers today. There are a great deal of movements that make
a lot of sense if one can imagine the crowded dance floors of Buenos Aires.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Of course, every so often
we hear cries of this is not Buenos Aires and these are the 90's and here
comes the tango of the new generation. These claims generate mostly from
groups with clever marketing strategies aimed solely to isolated communities
controlled by gatekeepers who seek empowerment by facilitating the implementation
of those marketing plans.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Those who have visited Buenos
Aires know that space on the dance floor is at a premium, regardless of
the size of the venue. Indeed, dancing Tango has become once again a major
attraction for a loyal legion of dancers in the capital city of Argentina.
There are new dancers, but they are dancing the same "old" Tango in a variety
of styles.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In Buenos Aires, regardless
of the dancing style you prefer and the club or confiteria you like the
most, there are well respected codes of the milonga that deal with the
way Argentinos invite and get invited to dance, and the way they manage
to dance with enjoyment and proficiency in what would seem to be an impossible
lack of space for those who are prisoners of the Eight Count Basic, and
those who are eager to try the newly acquired movements characteristic
of the new tango.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>As the ladies get strategically
seated around the periphery of the dance floor by the host, they face the
gentlemen who in most places are seated across the floor, or on stools
by the bar. As any red blooded Argentino will tell you, no man will dance
unless a lady invites him. She does so by unmistakenly seeking his attention
with her face and making direct eye contact with him. The "famous" nod
of the head used by the men is actually a reassuring question, "me?" The
flicker of her eyes, the subtle nodding of her head or her delicate smile
means, "yes, you!" The chosen one then confidently walks towards the lady
without loosing eye contact. When he is a couple of feet away she stands
up and facing the center of the dance floor waits for him to come to stand
in front of her.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Given these typical conditions
it only comes naturally that after embracing her, the man will initiate
the dance with a side step to his left, into the line of dance. Once this
movement takes place, the dancers have an infinite variety of movements
to continue.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Because of the crowded conditions,
the use of parallel feet walking, which requires about one-and-a-half body
widths of dance floor space, is often combined or replaced with crossed
feet walking, which only uses one body width of dance floor space. Taking
the lady to the cruzada is now executed with both bodies remaining in Position
One, that is with both dancers fully in front of each other.</font></font>
<h3>
Technical aspects of the salida cruzada</h3>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The most common way to initiate
a salida cruzada is for the man to do a traspie immediately after his side
step to the left. That means to change his weight as the right leg closes
so the second step will also be done with his left.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The way the bodies line up
for the second step of the salida varies according to how the bodies are
aligned when the first step is taken.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Following the description
of the common way to start the dance, the woman faces the center of the
dance floor while the man is with his back to the center of the dance floor.
(Photo 1, is taken from behind the lady's perspective as the dancers prepare
to start assuming Body Position One)</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>First, they take a side step
staying fully aligned in front of each other. The man transfers his weight
to his left to mark the lady a full step to her right.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Next, he changes his weight
back to his right, while doing a half turn to his left. Hs upper body rotates
the woman over her right foot, facing her back into the line of dance.
With her weight completely on her right foot and fully elongated, her left
leg is weighless resting next to her right. (Photo 2).</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Next, the man transfers his
weight back to his left slightly flexing his knee. This result in a mark
is to "push" the woman "off balance" so her free left leg extends behind
her to carry the motion of her body. Her metatarsus seeks for the space
behind her. As she firmly pushes down with her metatarsus, her lower leg
elongates, her heel touches the ground and her weight is now over her left
foot. The second step has been completed and both dancers are now crossed
feet, that is, they are both stepping with the same foot, the left in this
case (Photo 3).</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>With the weight solid on
his left leg, the man now marks the next step of the woman by advancing
with his right foot and using his upper body to place her right foot back
in line with her left foot (Photo 4).</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Finally, while transfering
his weight completely on his right foot, he continues to project his upper
body forward marking the woman's next step. In this case, applying a slight
pressure with his right arm on the woman's torso, he places her left foot
in front of her right foot, bringing her completely on front of him in
a cruzada position (Photo 5).</font></font>
