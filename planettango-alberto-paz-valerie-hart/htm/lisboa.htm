soon as we entered a small door carved at the foot of a hill. Little is
known about the origin of this piece of poetry expressing pain,
sadness, full of emotion, except that it was probably sung by slaves or
sailors brought to shore by ships traveling across the oceans from
remote continents.</font> </p>

Buenos Aires and in New Orleans, both port cities, both early colonies,
both cradles of tango and jazz respectively.</font> <br>

interrupted as a voice from the shadows of the room said, <i>"Hush,
the fado is going to be sung."</i> The sound of a guitar and a mandolin
preceded the voices of men and women as they took turns to pour out
their hearts with tales of lost love, hopes and dejection. We were in
another port city, an early colony, where a hundred people have
promised to show us their love of the tango, their understanding of its
ethos, and the way they treasure the opportunities to embrace and
dance. <i>"It's because of the fado,"</i> they have said, when after
months of exchanging e-mails, Alex invited us to come
to Lisbon to teach tango.</font></td>

      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">After having spent one week in
Italy teaching at Villa La Rogaia in Umbria, it was time&nbsp; to get
on the road, the railroad that is. The ride was wonderful, relaxing,
and picturesque. The daylight finally turned to darkness around 10 PM,
and by breakfast time, we were again speeding across the French
countryside. In Paris, with four hours to spare, we had lunch near the
Gare du Montparnasse, and wrote a whole bunch of postcards to our
friends before boarding the high speed train to Lisbon.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The vineyards of Bordeaux flirted
so briefly as the train sped by, with an invitation to degust the
fermented elixir of its grapes to which we could only wave regrets. Our
excitement for the days ahead had no point of reference, no prior
experience to draw upon, and no knowledge of how the Portuguese
approached the tango.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At over 200 m.p.h., seven
unforgettable days were peeling from our eyes and lodging in our
memory. The intensity of La Rogaia's days and nights, the warmth and
scent from the good bye hugs still fresh in our bodies, and the
exhilaration of having opened new eyes to the magical spell of our
tango, made it very hard to imagine what lay ahead for us in the land
of Vasco da Gama.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The sun had set once more and the
names on the billboards of the cities that were passing by the windows
indicated that we had left France and we were now traveling through
Spain. The topic of conversation at dinner time included which language
we would be using to teach in Portugal. A couple of days later we would
be standing up in front of fifty dancers, beginning our class in
English, Europe's second language, we had been told, only to be asked
politely if we could switch to Spanish, a language which lusitanos were
very familiar with.</font> <br>

were having our first taste of Portuguese hospitality as the train
porter, attentive without being intrusive, refilled our glasses with
the bouquet of porto. Soon our eyes shut down, our bodies went to
sleep, and our minds dreamed of all the things to come.</font>
            <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Dozing off and on from
village to village, from valleys to mountain passes, and from sunshine
to moonlight, we couldn't anticipate that in the seven days ahead of
us, we would be part of some unbelievable experiences. The hands down
favorites to win the World Cup, Argentina's national soccer team would
be unceremoniously sent packing back to a depressed Buenos Aires. After
boarding a state-of-the-art train in the City of Lights, we would
disembark and it would seem that we had traveled back in time to what
Europe looked like fifty years ago. When entering the basement ballroom
of the one-hundred-year-old Clube Estefania, we would gasp and shudder
at the intense energy irradiating from the embraces of over twenty-five
couples obliviously dancing in a collective state of trance.</font></p>

intrepid sailors set to sea in search of undiscovered continents and
unimaginable fortunes. We would drink port wine, green wine, and more
wine. We would taste delicacies at established restaurants, eat family
style at the cafeteria of the Clube Estefania, and occupy one of five
tables eating with the locals at a hole in the wall by the riverside.</font></td>

      <font face="Arial,Helvetica">There would be days when we would
explore the narrow and curvy alleys of the Barrio Alto, the oldest
settlement in Lisbon, and the center of its night life. On the way down
we would spend hours at a flea market perched on several blocks of
uphill and down hill streets. We would be able to do this day after day
because in Lisbon, we would learn, the tango is a late night activity.
Our tango activities would consist of daily three hour sessions
starting at 7 PM, followed by dancing from 11 PM until 3 or 4 in the
morning. In the process we would become affectionately attached to a
group of people who loved to dance not just tango, but quizomba, an
African rhythm which sounded like a mix of Brazilian samba and Cuban
rumba.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We would swiftly be overtaken by
the care, love and respect that the Lisbon tangueros profess for the
tango, its
cultural roots, and the people whose original image it reflects. We
would
quickly understand the meaning of saudade, an emotional state of being
nostalgic. We would be immersed in a love fest of embraces and
osculations. We would quickly learn to love the unique sounds of a
language which reads like Spanish, but sounds like a carioca bossa nova.</font>

Sunday at the Club Barraca, we would see the full force of quizomba,

intricacy of the tango, and attracted by the sensual appeal of the
tango dancers.</font> <br>

another facet of Ale's artistic life. The Argentine expatriate, a
musician, modern dancer and Portugal's leading tango promoter, would be
the soul of the Barraca spinning music, arousing the crowd with the
beat he kept banging on a cow bell, and playing a composition of his
own to which the entire room would take to the floor and burst into a
spontaneous line dance.</font> <br>

we woke up to see another morning&nbsp; and a shroud of fog carpeting

before noon on June 11, the train pulled into the old terminal by the
river. Something special was about to begin: <i>"Maestros Alberto y
Valorie ben-vindo a Lisboa,"</i> said Jose Serrao welcoming us to his
city. Soon we were in a taxi climbing the narrow streets of old Lisbon
on our way to the hotel. A couple of hours, a shower, and a few
sardines later, Alejandro and Solange, our hosts, picked us up to take
us out to dinner and listen to the Fado.</font></td>
