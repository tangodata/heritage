MISSING CARLITOS<br>
      </div>
      <div class="text"><br>
Every year on this date, June 24th, I'm haunted by the image of the
freak airplane crash that took the lives of Carlos Gardel and Alfredo
Lepera in 1935.<br>
      <br>
For most folks born outside South America, it is nearly impossible to
understand what it meant for the nation of Argentina, and many other
South American countries, to wake up on the morning of June 25, 1935 to
the chilling news shaped in bold letters headlines that, except for
minor variations in copy, were saying the same unthinkable fact: <b>GARDEL
IS DEAD</b>.<br>
      <br>
Gardel and Lepera had become very successful partners in the
tango-for-films department. Under contract with Paramount, Carlos
Gardel was becoming a box office attraction in South America because of
his personal appeal, his baritone voice, and his successful tours
around Western Europe. Yet, the underlying attraction of Gardel, the
music and lyrics of his tangos, had presented
a public relations problem for the Hollywood suits. There was something
about the language and jargon embedded in the lyrics of the tangos
Gardel
sang that didn't fly very well outside Buenos Aires. <br>
      <br>
So they brought Alfredo Lepera, a Brazilian born writer and poet then
living in Buenos Aires. His mission was to write new lyrics in a more
palatable Castillian language that would be universally understood and
appreciated in
all of South America and Spanish speaking Europe.<br>
      <br>
The resulting body of work represents the most popular and celebrated
songs that are easily recognized by people all over the world, even
when many may not realize that they were all written for films starring
Carlos Gardel.<br>
      <br>
Can you remember hearing any of these titles: Cuesta abajo, Volver,
Melodia de arrabal, El dia que me quieras, Por una cabeza...? &nbsp;It
was during a promotional tour for his latest film, El dia que quieras,
that Gardel and Lepera met their untimely deaths. First Puerto
Rico, then Cuba and finally Colombia were visits that attracted large
crowds eager to see, touch and listen to Carlos Gardel.</div>
      </td>

    <tr>

EL DIA QUE ME QUIERAS, Carlos Gardel<br>
      <embed
 src="../lyrics/Empeethree/EL%20DIA%20QUE%20QUIERAS_Gardel.mp3"
 autostart="false" volume="50" height="60" width="144"> <br>
Towards the end of the tour, Gardel and his entourage boarded a plane
at Medellin airport for a short flight to Cali, where he would make his
final appearance on a radio program before returning to New York,
in time to board a ship to Buenos Aires to fulfill a promise he had
made to his mother, that is, spending more time with her. The aircraft
never got completely airborne as it suddenly veered of course and
slammed into another aircraft waiting to enter the runway. Among a
twisted pile
of melting metal and an infernal blaze, Gardel ended his mortal
existence.<br>
      <br>
Almost instantly he became immortal, and his image, his legacy and his
works eternally became the subject of a religious adoration and
veneration for a large majority of people spanning many generations.<br>
      <br>
When his remains arrived in Buenos Aires almost a year later, the city
came to a grinding halt. He laid in wake for a day at the Luna Park
arena, located where Corrientes Avenue begins to grow up into the
heart of the city. Dignitaries, musicians, singers, artists, and plain
people all shed tears of sorrow and mourning before his casket
began its final journey along Corrientes Avenue to the cemetery of
Chacarita where he was laid to rest. The slow pace of the funeral march
was accentuated by a shower of flowers and tears being cast from every
balcony and every door along the way.<br>
      <br>
Carlos Gardel began singing at a very young age. Raised in poverty and
with limited means of survival, he managed to get singing gigs at
weddings, birthdays and other family receptions. His repertoire was
mostly made out of Creole compositions, a genre that included folk
songs and rural milongas typically accompanied by one or more guitars.
Gradually he began to hang out at some seedy cantinas surrounding the
old Mercado de Abasto, a sort of central wholesale market. Visitors
today may have noticed a subway station under Corrientes Avenue named
after Gardel. A super modern mega shopping center stands above on the
grounds of the old Mercado de Abasto. It was in one of those cantinas
that he faced Uruguayan folk singer Jose Razzano in what was supposed
to be a duel for supremacy
and ended up becoming a sensational duo that started performing at
theaters, clubs, and cabarets around the country and in neighboring
Uruguay.<br>
      <br>
The story goes that sometime in 1917 Gardel was approached in
Montevideo by a street poet who had a penchant for writing risky lyrics
to existing tango music. Gardel loved what Pascual Contursi had
written for a tango named Lita composed by Samuel Castriota. In private
gatherings he was amused at Contursi's clever use of lunfardo
expressions to describe the sappy tale of a pimp in love who laid awake
at night hoping for the return of his former whore.<br>
      <br>
It began with, "Percanta que me amuraste, en lo mejor de mi vida..."
(Woman who left me at the best moment of my life) and ended with,<br>
"Porque tu luz no ha querido, mi noche triste alumbrar..." (Because
your light (talking to a lamp in the room) has not wanted to illuminate
my sad night." And those three last words, MI NOCHE TRISTE,
became the title of the first and foremost tango lyrics, setting the
stage for a rich chapter in the glorious book of tango history.<br>
      <br>
Going against the advice of his friends, Gardel decided to take a
chance singing "Mi noche triste" at a theater performance. Razzano
bailed out, and Carlos Gardel made history by singing his first tango
in public, sending the audience into a frenzy and receiving a standing
ovation.<br>
      <br>
What followed was a body of work touching on tales of love, hate,
infidelity, and crimes of passion depicting the fictional relationships
between pimps and their whores. Record companies couldn't press enough
vinyl to keep up with the demand, and many popular bards followed
Contursi's suit and inundated the market with one of the most prolific
productions of lyrics in tango history.<br>
      <br>
Gradually, Gardel began to incorporate tangos in his recordings, and
by the early nineteen twenties the popular demand and the pressure from
the record companies made him become a full time tango singer.<br>
      <br>
Soon he traveled to Spain and was met with great success. Then he
ventured into Paris where he became the darling of a decadent
aristocracy who catapulted him into international fame. He kept
returning to Buenos Aires in what became trips "to enjoy the city as a
visitor, rather than as a resident."<br>
      <br>
The Radio Broadcasting Company brought him to New York from where he
made history by broadcasting a program via telephone lines to Buenos
Aires. Paramount saw in Gardel their golden opportunity to enter the
Latin American film market. At the time of his death, he had become an
idol among fans from all over
Latin America.<br>
      <br>
So, if shouldn't come as a surprise that this June 24th, as it has been
happening since 1935, men and women in Peru, Colombia, Ecuador,
Venezuela, Bolivia, Uruguay, Puerto Rico, Nicaragua, El Salvador and
Mexico will listen to Gardel with a very special purpose, to continue
paying respect to his memory, to continue admiring a singer that sings
better every day.<br>
      <br>
When Gardel died, so did the hopes of any aspiring singer to ever reach
universal acceptance. Agustin Magaldi and Ignacio Corsini were great
popular singers contemporaries of Gardel but withered under his
shadow. Horacio Deval's register was identical to Gardel's so he was
chastised for that, and in spite of a short success with the Horacio
Salgan orchestra, he never achieved popular recognition. People have
found Horacio Deval and heard him sing the Gardel repertoire at one of
the many Argentine restaurants and tanguerias in the city of Miami,
where he had been residing for many years until his recent death.<br>
      <br>
Uruguayan born Julio Sosa came very close to reach the pinnacle but his
life was cut short in a car accident. Roberto 'El Polaco' Goyeneche
reached cult-like following and respect, but he managed to
age and deteriorate in the eyes of the public. They say that it will
snow again in Buenos Aires the day a replacement for Gardel is born.<br>
      <br>
Perhaps what it is most important to understand about Gardel, the man,
the myth, the icon, is the identification that the common people of
Buenos Aires have with his rise to fame from humble beginnings. With
his unmatched fame and success, and his eternal smile, he has been
shining a ray of hope over the tribulations of those who face life
challenges from a less than ideal social standing. Gardel is the
epitome of the socially challenged immigrant who made it out of the
tenement and into
the royal palaces of Europe all the while retaining the modesty,
humility, loyalty and generosity of those who never forget the friends
they make on their way up because they know that they'll still be there
when it's time to come down. The eternal smile reminds us of that.</div>
