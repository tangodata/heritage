<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Dear Valorie and Alberto</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Thank you very much for
the wonderful weekend at Reno during the “PLANET TANGO Fifth Annual Labor
Day Weekend Tango Getaway”.&nbsp; But, if you will allow me to be so bold,
there is something bothering me that I have to tell you.&nbsp; Please take
this as constructive criticism.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In all your advertisements
Tango has always been mentioned.&nbsp; It is always the “catch” word.&nbsp;
You can understand my disappointment when approximately 80 percent of the
steps taught was Melonga.&nbsp; I came there to learn more Tango steps.&nbsp;
Anybody who saw your advertisements would be expecting to be learning Tango.&nbsp;
Of course if one does not know the difference between the two then it might
not matter to them, but to those of us that know and came to Reno, it does
matter.&nbsp; May I suggest that in the future, you put a disclaimer in
your advertisements saying that people who come will be learning mostly
Melonga.&nbsp; This way, people who come will know&nbsp; exactly what to
expect.&nbsp; Thank you for reading this letter and letting me express
my feelings.</font></font></b>

<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I remember packing my
bags thinking it will probably be another typical tango workshop weekend.
Tired feet, so so food, uncomfortable hotel bed...&nbsp; BOY WAS I WRONG!</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Reno was like a wake
up call. I was reminded that Tango was about making good friends, being
loved, enjoying the music, feeling the passion, sharing the fun.</font></font></b>

dance halls, super hotel rooms and best of all, fantastic host and hostess.</font></font></b>

Valorie.&nbsp; Their love for Tango is sincere and their desire to share
their passion with others is unmatched.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>They are givers and they
came through big time in Reno.&nbsp; It felt more like a family reunion
than a workshop.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I know putting together
the Reno weekend was a tremendous effort, hard work, stressful nights,
months of planning, pulling hair. It nevershowed. They smiled and hugged

Tango is to have FUN.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>And what can I say about
the workshops? World class teachers that worked hard at cracking through

<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>TO: ARGENTINE TANGO OPEN
FORUM</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Dear list,</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Carlota and I just returned
from the Tango Get-Away in Reno, where we had a wonderful time.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>First (for you skimmers),
I need to say to those of you around the U.S. who have a chance to meet
and study with GLORIA AND EDUARDO, and to see them dance: DON'T MISS THEM.
Man, they are the goods. They don't come to the</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>States very often. I
am very, very thankful that I had the opportunity.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The Reno weekend was a
big friendly party from beginning to end, filled with non-stop intensity.
We came away with a lot to chew on from classes, and nothing but pleasurable
memories.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Friday night we arrived,
checked in, and then went downstairs to register.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>A little distance behind
the table Gloria and Eduardo were standing and chatting with people as
they arrived. I had never met them before, but I instantly recognized who
they were, and they turned, smiled and said hello.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I was amused by how normal
they looked ... Eduardo w/o fedora, studious looking in his big black-frame
glasses. Gloria, what a beautiful face and charming smile. On video they
seem so much larger than life. Here they were, just friendly people.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>A milonga was already
in progress in the registration room, and Alberto and Valorie were both
dancing (Pablo and Beatriz, the third teaching couple, had a delayed flight
and arrived much later). Carlota and I immediately hit the dance floor,
and thus began a weekend of some of the most warm and fun-filled tango
dancing we've ever experienced.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Saturday through Monday
were classes, classes, classes. Students were divided into three rooms,
and the teachers rotated to these different rooms. Class size was reasonable,
and the dancing level of everyone in our class was pretty uniform. The
teachers taught the same material to each room, so everyone learned the
same material. We were able to make personal-use-only videotapes of the
classes (which was a good thing because I didn't have my usual time afterwards
to write notes).</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Alberto and Valorie worked
with us on rhythm, double-time steps, and changes of direction. A strong
emphasis on concepts. Music was typically D'Arienzo school, and on the
third day, Di Sarli (I think). Their material fed into the other teachers'
lessons seemlessly.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Pablo and Beatriz, who
I had not heard of before, presented in three sessions a simple and beautiful
salon style sequence, emphasizing partner connection. In style they remind
me a bit of Guillermo and Fernanda. As examples of quality of movement
they were superb. This is the kind of thing that you imbibe by being around
it, and it's not really part of the teaching. I am surprised to find, now
that I am home, that I have retained an unconscious impression from them
that affects how I hear and dance to the music. I realize now, how important
it is to be near tango dancers of</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>this level ... to see
their movement in different circumstances, to soak it up. It gives you
an internal idea of how to dance. A model.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Eduardo and Gloria taught
one class each in milonga ("a la tango"), vals crusado, and tango club
style. At the beginning of each class, Eduardo would give a little preamble
about the history and context of each dance style before he put on the
music. We lined up behind him and Gloria for a warm-up with the steps to
be used in the class. Eduardo clapped his hands, we walked, and from then
on we were immersed in rhythm and tempo. Their classes really roll along,
filled with mirth and energy. A brief explanation, a demonstration, then
everybody tries it. There was nothing fancy about the movement vocabulary.
And not a lot of talk from Eduardo and Gloria -- some crucial points were
explained, but mostly the pedagogy felt like "come dance with us, we'll
show you". I may be a little star struck by this couple, but I have to
report that they just exude the essence of tango. Music pours out of their
bodies, and they make you a part of it. He</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>whistles, he sings along,
he claps his hands. Their foot taps have the most contagious rhythm. Many
times I fought back tears in these classes. I can't explain why, they were
just moving.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Seeing Eduardo and Gloria
dance in class was inspiring and awesome, yet it felt approachable. They
always got a round of applause from the class, even when they only did
six steps. Seeing them dance in performance at the</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Saturday night milonga
was overpowering. Mastery, roots, skill, compositional balance, projection,
drama, comedy, timing, simultaneous spontaneity and control, everything.
I have two new heros and they are Eduardo and Gloria.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Milongas on Saturday and
Sunday evening, with two excellent buffet dinners, and the most amazing
live music, gave everyone a chance to enjoy themselves. I think I learned
as much from dancing in the evenings as during the classes. And the musicians
were unbelievable. They got many ovations after their numbers. I think
often tango groups today play more from a musician's point of view more
than from a dancer's point of view.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>This band was a dance
band, and I'd as soon dance to them as _any_ recording. Really.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>My praise and gratitude
go to the organizers, Alberto and Valorie, for their good judgement, hard
work, and unstinting generosity, which gave us an outstanding weekend of
great fun and also great depth. And I want to thank all the women I had
the privilege to dance with in classes as well as in the evenings; you
were all so wonderful.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>My last three words: GLORIA
AND EDUARDO!</font></font></b>

have gladly traveled twice the distance to dance to/hear) - and the details,

There is a great proliferation of tango schools, milongas plus all sorts

their meaning. Anyway, having said all that, I'll proceed directly to post
my report about our last experience.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>We just returned from
the 2001 Tango Getaway in Reno, where Alberto Paz and Valorie Hart were
our gracious hosts. To begin with, I must confess that up until now we
have not had as nice a time at any other tango event that we've attended.
I had the wonderful opportunity to perform as the translator for Gloria
and Eduardo at their workshops. I only knew Gloria and Eduardo from the
firts instructional tango video I ever saw. I really had no idea of who
they were or what kind of people they were. I must tell you all that Gloria
and Eduardo are very, very talented. Without doubt they are as good as
any and better than most teachers that I've had the priviledge to learn
from. More importantly, they are extremely nice people. Eduardo is quite
charismatic and both are delightful to work with.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>My only regret is that
I did not get the chance to take the classes with Pablo and Beatriz or
Alberto and Valorie. OTOH, I did have the opportunity to socialize with
them at the parties so all was not lost ;-) Anyway, what makes or breaks
an event is not necessarily any one or even a number of the many pieces
that that go into the staging of the whole enchilada. As an organizer,
I'm very familiar with all the work needed and all the details that must
be taken care of to make a successful event. Things such as the venue,
teaching staff, music and support staff are crucial. In this case, it is
obvious that Alberto has done his homework very well.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The Reno Hilton is very
comfortable (and extremely affordable) and it is practically a small, self
contained city! there are many restaurants and cafes, open 24 hours a day.
There are stores, health club, fast food outlets, etc. All within easy
access. Alberto provided for two evenings that included&nbsp; great food,
live music and entertaining. I was very favorably impressed with the food
(and I'm quite picky because in Atlanta we are blessed with numerous excellent
restaurants). The inevitable things that go awry were so minor as to be
negligible. The music was awesome. Alberto did not cut corners here at
all. The sextet was terrific. Miguel Arrabal and David Alsina provide the
bandoneons, Jorge Vernieri at the Piano plus two violinists and a bass
player rounded out the ensemble. I was already familiar with most of the
musicians, but I had never heard them all play at the same time. I must
confess that the music was really as good as it gets!</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Of course, these are all
the pieces that usually come together to make a successful tango event.
One expects no less from a professional. We always strive to produce events
like this and we always succeed. I'm also very familiar with the great
work of Victor Crichton in Tampa, Randy Pittman in Miami and of course,
Gustavo Naveira and Fabian Salas in Buenos Aires. We've also had the opportunity
to attend a host of other events all over the US and other countries. What
made this event so nice for us, was the way we were treated. Alberto and
Valorie, the teaching staff, the musicians and all the wonderful participants
were just so wonderful with us that it really made it a most enjoyable
weekend. I will also say that for us, the level of dance partners was excellent.
Granted, I did not get to dance with every woman there (my loss I'm sure
;-)), but I definitely enjoyed many wonderful tangos as well as excellent
conversations with very gracious folks.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>My thanks to Alberto Paz
and Valorie for a wonderful time and greetings to all of you who were there.
A warm greeting also to Walter (tangringo) Kane who I finally got to meet.
It was also nice to see the Restuchas and Daniel Arredondo from North Carolina,
they are always a pleasure to see and by the way, Amalia &amp; Tito did
a wonderful milonga performance! also, Daniel danced a wonderful tango
performance as well! I cannot mention everyones name but I really want
to congratulate all the wonderfull people who performed Sunday night and
I want to send all my best, greetings to all the other fine folks who were
there and made it such a fine and memorable experience for us!</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Cheers,</font></font></b>
