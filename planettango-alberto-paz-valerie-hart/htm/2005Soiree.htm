The friendship of all was so warm and inviting that the comfort level
upon entering the door was pure love....of people.....of tango.....of
food.....of sharing.....and care!<br>

Thanks so much for a
wonderful evening, and thank you so much for sharing us with Argentina
in your Fabulous tango editorial film to be aired in BA.<br>
New Orleans&nbsp; and our tango community was indeed shown at its very

A
most pleasurable evening amongst good friends</span><br>

      <br>

Just wanted to thank you for the invitation to share in last evening's
fabulous food, films, and friendship.
It is always a pleasure for me to spend time at Valorie and Alberto's
beautiful home, and to partake of the graciousness and warmth with
which they entertain their friends and lovers of tango.<br>
      <br>
I am so appreciative of the effort that Alberto went to, in preparing
traditional Argentine empanadas... They were delicious! We all ate more
than our fill of the delicious foods and sweets that he made, or that
were brought and shared by other guests.<br>
      <br>
The video
portion of the evening was a real treat. We can now add film editing to
Alberto's list of many talents! It was a privilege to get a "sneak
preview" of the video from the 2004 New Orleans TangoFest, and of the
piece that will be shown on Argentine television featuring tango in New
Orleans. <br>
      <br>

While there was plenty of tango, in many varieties, well
presented in both pieces, I think the thing that makes each uniquely
special is the interspersing of music and footage of scenes of the life
and spirit of the city we call home.(I especially liked the scenes of
Miz V dressed to the nines for the Easter parades).
      <br>
      <br>
The joy that is continuously celebrated, and the love that we all share
for our community (both of New Orleans and Tango) is presented in a way
that I think will be vibrant and palpable for viewers of these videos.
