again for another great New Orleans TangoFest! We know you had a great time
last year at the beautiful and sensual Hotel Monaco, in the beautiful and
sensual city of New Orleans, doing the most beautiful and sensual dance -
the Argentine tango! So reunite with friends you made last year, and make
new friends this year.The fourth edition of the New Orleans TangoFest follows
the tradition of the granddaddy of all three-day festivals, the <a
 href="http://www.planet-tango.com/2001reno.htm">Reno Tango Getaway</a>,
successfully produced and hosted by VALORIE HART and ALBERTO PAZ from 1997
to 2001 at the Reno Hilton, Nevada.<br>
        <br>
 The New Orleans TangoFest is unique because it is produced with the discriminating
tango dancer in mind. Year after year many people continue to make the TangoFest
the highlight of their tango year. The reason is that we work very hard to
show you how we truly enjoy the joy of dancing tango by setting the highest
standards of excellence.<br>
        <br>
  The venue where the festival is held is the Hotel Monaco, a facility truly
designed for the indulgence of all senses. It is a mere three blocks from
the French Quarter, yet, it affords the civilized environment of a well appointed
micro center with reliable public transportation within walking distance.
People raved about our choice of the Hotel Monaco last year.<br>
       <br>
  We need not tell you how wonderful the accommodations at The Hotel Monaco
are - remember the lovely well appointed rooms (with Aveeda bath products
and those sexy leopard terry cloth robes?), and the lovely complimentary
wine hour held in the stylish lobby living room every day (with the in house
masseuse ready to give your neck a complimentary massage). The regular guest
rooms are quite luxe, including a goldfish to keep you company, but if you&#8217;d
care to upgrade to a suite, at an additional charge, please let us know -
the upgraded suites have large jacuzzis! <br>

PAZ and VALORIE HART are two of the premier professional tango event organizers
in the nation. They are also as great teachers. They have developed a successful
method to introduce, review and reinforce the essential elements of the structure
of the dance, the codes and protocols associated with it, and the rituals
that define the personal styling that characterizes a "bailarin de tango."
They can cover basic, intermediate, and advanced technique, floor craft,
and music awareness. Their classes are specifically designed to move beyond
step collection, overcome short attention span, and correct the bad habits
that result from imitation.<br>
       <br>
 Like all of the natural 'bailarines de tango' born before 1945, ALBERTO PAZ
never studied contact improvisation or modern dance. He grew up as a natural
dancer on the streets of Buenos Aires as the Golden Era of tango was beginning
to decline. Almost 40 years later ALBERTO led the Renaissance of tango in
the USA as an active promoter in California managing visiting professional
dancers, publishing El Firulete, the first Argentine tango newsletter, and
hosting weekly tango dance parties and a tango radio program. Through most
of the 1990's, ALBERTO developed long lasting friendships with and benefited
from the guidance and life experience of Orlando Paiva, Eduardo Arquimbau,
Rodolfo Cieri, Carlos Gavito and other great 'bailarines de tango.'<br>
        <br>
 VALORIE HART is ballet trained with off-Broadway and summer stock dancing
experience with a unique quality for dancing and teaching Argentine Tango.
They studied together in Buenos Aires with renowned master Mingo Pugliese.
Since 1997 they have toured the USA perfecting a clear and fair methodology
for teaching successful promoting the authentic form of Argentine tango dancing 
in cities from Anchorage to Dallas, from Honolulu to New York and dozens
of cities in between.<br>
        <br>
 Since 2002 they have been invited to teach in Europe receiving praise for
their solid understanding of technique and their clear and fair method of
delivery. ALBERTO is recognized as a seasoned milonguero with a modern mindset.
VALORIE epitomizes the powerful, yet exquisite role of the woman in the tango.<br>

Argentina, the Paivas live in Rosario, the city that gave the world the legendary
Orlando Paiva. A new generation of Paiva offsprings are now teaching and performing
also in Buenos Aires. They have taught and performed in Europe (Spain, Germany)
and in USA (San Francisco, Los Angeles, Reno) where people loved the romantic
and elegant style that has become the hallmark of the Paiva legacy. <br>
       <br>
 Both are pure TANGO dancers and teachers. They were born and grew up in
a Tango atmosphere, respecting and loving this dance. Following the basis
of their special style, they dance feeling the floor. Their performances
are distinctive in its movements and esthetic, giving you a masterful blend
of ARGENTINA.<br>
       <br>
When you see them dancing, you will not only see their fluidity, foot position
       and precision, you will be allowed to see something very special.<br>
       <br>
They are incredibly wonderful instructors,         but moreover, there character
and demeanor are top of the line. <br>
They represent the qualities of "old world" sincerity          and simplicity
which when combined with their skill make for an<br>
         incredibly dynamic duo&#8220;.           <br>
       <br>
 Whether you come to improve your traditional tango or to experience the the
extension of a legacy, you will find their teaching to be excellent.<b>

       <td style="vertical-align: top;" colspan="4">Another fabulous New
Orleans Tangofest has come and gone. Over 120 people came together to celebrate
social tango dancing at its best.<br>
       <br>
 Friday night&#8217;s kick off event was the original show &#8220;Red Hot Tango&#8221;, a dance
revue based on the social dance history of tango. Cleverly interwoven with
a sensual voice over with spot-on musical interludes and&nbsp; apropos tangos,
valses and milongas, were examples of social tango dancing from the 1920&#8217;s
until the present day.<br>
       <br>
 Michael Serry and Julie Ann Stillman from Santa Barbara kicked off the dance
numbers with a&nbsp; sassy milonga/candombe to Di Sarli&#8217;s La Mulateada. Next
up from Troy, Michigan came Doug and Suzanne MacGeorge dancing a precious
canyengue to Julio de Caro&#8217;s El Pillette.<br>
       <br>
 Threading the influences of other social dances that formed the tango culminated
in a spectacular social dance style fox trot by Mike Muscemi and Susaune
Yee McKamey (New Orleans), who looked as if they jumped out of a 1930&#8217;s black
and white movie onto the black and white dance floor.<br>
       <br>
 Then came the guest teachers, Orlando Paiva, Jr. and Rebekah Abbey, who danced
to Di Sarli&#8217;s Comme Il Faut, in a flawless example of elegance, bodies held
close, feet never leaving the floor, their tango filled with smooth music.<br>
       <br>
 Up next, hosts, event producers and master teachers Alberto and Valorie,
showed us the moves that led to the way we socially dance tango now, an homage
to Petroleo, executing giro after giro to Troilo&#8217;s Guapeando.<br>
       <br>
 The holy trinity of tango dancing was rounded out by Doug and Suzanne dancing
a crowd pleasing milonga to Canaro&#8217;s Milonga Criolla; Orlando and Rebekah
charmed everyone with a vals danced to Pugliese&#8217;s Desde el Alma.<br>
       <br>
 Michael and Julie Ann did a wonderful rendition of the 1950&#8217;s petitero, segueing
into a number by Alberto and Valorie danced to D&#8217;Arienzo&#8217;s El Flete, illustrating
the caquero&#8217;s discovery of the milonguero.<br>
       <br>
 Then onto to modern times, with Michael and Julie dancing a tango to Che
Tango Che by Gidon Kremer.<br>
 Next, Alberto and Valorie danced slow, close and sensual to Color Tango&#8217;s
Tango A Pugliese.<br>
       <br>
 As the tradition of tango hospitality dictates, guest teachers Orlando and
Rebekah closed out the solo numbers dancing a breathtaking tango to Troilo&#8217;s
Quejas De Bandoneon.<br>
       <br>
 For the finale, each man chose a lady not his partner, to dance the finale
- Tanturi&#8217;s Una Emocion, to show that in social dancing, it is not only possible
but enjoyable to dance with anyone who chooses to dance with you. None of
the dancers had ever danced with their chosen ladies, nor had the ladies
previously danced with the men.<br>
       <br>
 The costume changes were imaginative and quick! Each outfit conveyed a different
era. There was a lot of charming stage business. Highlights included Valorie
dressed as a man marching the other bigger guys around the floor. Also amusing
was the cast of porte&ntilde;os watching an imaginary movie screen, where
Fred Astaire was performing Top Hat - the porte&ntilde;os made a game attempt
to imitate Fred&#8217;s elegance, with comical results.<br>
       <br>
 The show was sold out, integrating the TangoFest participants along with
the general public. Much excitement was in the air, and new tango dancers
were being born that very moment!<br>
       <br>
 After the show, a great milonga went on until the last dancers happily dragged
themselves off to bed to look forward to two day&#8217;s worth of interesting classes.
Gourmet sandwiches and fresh fruit and sweets were provided, for those who
skipped dinner, or just needed a little boost to keep up with the constant
flow of dancing.<br>
       <br>
 Saturday and Sunday classes were flawless and fun.<br>
 Each set of teachers challenged the dancers to improve their skill levels
and understanding of the structure of the tango, thus enabling and empowering
each of them to become a fully realized tango dancer. Two classrooms divided
the dancers into a couples room or a singles room. The singles room actually
had extra men!&nbsp; The level of dancing was on an even keel.&nbsp; Each
class size was limited to no more than 36 persons, so that plenty of personal
attention was given by both sets of teachers. Time was allotted for those
wishing a private class.<br>
       <br>
 Both dinners were so delicious. Saturday&#8217;s theme &#8220;The Lady In Red&#8221; brought
out some fabulous red dresses on the ladies. Red feather boas and red beads
were given to all, for just that added extra touch. No shows or announcements
on this night so that all could dance socially to their heart&#8217;s content.
Excellent state of the art dance floor and sound system (playing DJ Tangoman&#8217;s
perfect compilations) kept everyone going well past 1 AM.<br>
       <br>
 Sunday night is the highlight of the weekend. A student showcase happens.
This idea came out of the dance halls of Buenos Aires, where you would often
see a social dance couple take to the floor for a spot light dance to celebrate
a milestone. It is done in the spirit of sharing your tango. It is a remarkable
emotional love fest between the people watching and the dancers.<br>
       <br>
 Anyone can volunteer to dance in the showcase. Some dancers may have taken
their first steps in classes that weekend, and will come to center floor
on Sunday night and receive tremendous support and encouragement. Seasoned
dancers receive respect and appreciation. Social dancing improvised in the
moment, in front of your peers, gives all an authentic experience and an
exciting showcase.<br>
       <br>
 This year in the true spirit of the tango, Linda from New Orleans and Tony
from Phoenix stepped to the center for the first time ever (they hadn&#8217;t danced
with each before) and shared the most connected and real and exquisite tango
to Pugliese&#8217;s Nochero Soy. It felt as if everyone was a voyeur!<br>
       <br>
 Others who generously danced that night: Fred and Beth (tango) from Nevada,
Gordon and Laurie (vals) from Florida, Sabina and Eddie (vals) from New Orleans,
Curtis and Laura (tango) from Florida, Julio and Denise (tango) from New
Orleans, and soon to be a bride and groom in September, Alfonso and Anie
(tango) from New Orleans.<br>
       <br>
 Plenty of time was left to finish the very yummy Taste of New Orleans dinner
(where it was heard that the best bread pudding ever was served!), and to
dance until the last table was folded (going on 2 AM). Die hard dancers included
Orlando, Rebekah, Patricia, Sabina,&nbsp; Erwin, Michael, Jessica, Denise,
Julio, Todd, Marizabel, Doug, Suzanne, Alberto, Valorie, and too many others
to name.<br>
       <br>
 The Hotel Monaco is the most sexy and classy and comfortable place to stay.
It is done up in the grand style of the 1940's, which matches the tango so
perfectly.<br>
       <br>
 Every afternoon at 5 PM the wine reception (complimentary wine) was packed
with chatty tango dancers. The plush terry cloth leopard bathrobes were sighted
around the hotel on various tango dancers.<br>
 Everybody really loves the luxury of the guest rooms for relaxing in between
classes and events (local dancers got their own Locals Lounge in the form
of one of the well appointed and spotless guest rooms).<br>
       <br>
 The Cobalt (hotel) restaurant is so cozy, and the shrimp over grits was
seen on many a dancer&#8217;s plate!<br>
 The staff at The Monaco is friendly and helpful. The same desk people, chamber
maids, waiters, doormen and managers remain year after year and they remember
us as much as we remember them. The Monaco is a pet friendly hotel and it
is so cool to see the pretty pooches laying at the feet of their owners in
the beautifully decorated public living rooms.<br>
       <br>
 The Planet Tango Boutique was packed with lots of good stuff - the Planet
Tango T-shirt design and poster were especially good this year; new Tara
tango shoes were seen on many of the ladies, and Charles Gillam the famous
folk artist did an incredible painted wood carving of Caminito that was snapped

dancers, excellent teachers, excellent place - next year, be there or be
nowhere<br>

       <td colspan="4" style="vertical-align: top;">Now that I have recovered
and had a chance to process some of the things I learned at Tango Fest, I
want to share my impressions.<br>
 What a great weekend!  As a newbie to the tango scene, I wasn't sure what
to expect. Twenty-four hours of tango over three days was a little intense.<br>
       <br>
 Friday night was a real eye-opener for me. I never realized there were so
many different styles of Argentine tango, from the oh so very up-close-and-personal
to the wildly flamboyant. And then to see dancers with such different styles
adapt so easily to one another on the dance floor The show was fabulous,
the milonga  afterward was great fun. I was inspired! Friday night really
set the tone for the whole weekend.<br>
       <br>
 I learned so much Saturday and Sunday, not only from the teachers but also
from my dance partners. After six hours of class, I was suffering from too
much information and too many hours in the same shoes. I decided to start
a new dance craze --- barefoot tango. Do you think it will catch on?  (BTW,
thanks for the "Local's Lounge."  It was great to have such a comfortable
place to put my feet up before that night's dancing.) Where did Valorie find
so many red feather boas for the Lady in Red milonga on Saturday?  The food
that night was incredible. Chef David English really displayed why he has
such an international reputation. <a
 href="http://www.cobaltrestaurant.com">Cobalt</a> has gone to the head of
my list of restaurants to recommend to my out-of&#8211;town visitors.<br>
       <br>
 The student showcase on Sunday was truly impressive. There were so many
fine dancers from all over, but what really impressed me was the quality
of our local dancers. Julio and Denise, Sabina and Eddie, the young couple,
Alphonso and Anie, who gave us a preview of their wedding dance, they were
all wonderful but what really blew me away was when Linda stepped onto the
floor with Tony from Phoenix, a man she had never danced with before that
night. WOW!  <br>
       <br>
 Every New Orleans dancer in the showcase was a testament to the excellence
of the instruction that ALBERTO and VALORIE give us every Tuesday night.<br>
       <br>
 Over the course of the weekend I met so many lovely people from all over:
California, Florida, Illinois. I danced with experienced milongueros and
beginners like myself. I saw people of all ages and backgrounds coming together
to share a common interest. There was just enough show to allow us to catch
our breath and get fired up and plenty of dancing to satisfy the most die-hard
aficionado.<br>
       <br>
 I had a wonderful time.  Thank you.<br>

       <td style="vertical-align: top;" colspan="4">We just returned from
the fourth New Orleans Tangofest, held which was the wekeend of August 5
- 7 at the Hotel Monaco in New Orleans.<br>
       <br>
 Friday night featured "Red Hot Tango," a Tango dance show that absolutely
rocked the packed house. Tangofest participants received free passes - tickets
were also available to the general public. (It was great to see the public
at large eager to see Tango performances.)<br>
       <br>
 The professional show covered the history of Tango and the development of
music and dance in Argentina and lands beyond.<br>
       <br>
 Workshops and classes filled the remainder of the weekend. (Nights allowed
participants to unwind with gourment dinners that were included in the Tangofest
package and nightly Milongas.)<br>
       <br>
 Instructors included hosts Alberto Paz and Valorie Hart, and Orlando Paiva
and Rebekah Abbey. Weekend workshops were held in twin ballrooms, accomodating
all the dancers who attended the sold-out event.<br>
       <br>
 Sunday night closed with a show featuring the many talented students - this
New Orleans tradition was extremely well-received and enjoyed by all - the
music finally stopped in the wee hours (around 2:00 AM!).<br>
       <br>
 The hotel was a delight. Well-appointed rooms, personal attention from the
hotel staff. A complimentary wine reception daily (5 -6 pm) gave everyone
a chance to meet and catch up on the day's activities. Many new friends were
made by all.<br>
       <br>
 Another gem was "Cobalt" - the exceptional restaurant located at the Hotel
Manaco. (Gourment dishes created by Chef David English.)<br>
       <br>
 A HUGE bravo to Alberto Paz and Valorie Hart for amost unforgettable event.<br>
