my appreciation for the wonderful classes and workshops. I was awed by
your excellent style of dance and of the effective, simple manner in
which
you demonstrated it. Spring weather literally came to Urbana the short
while you were here making little Tanguero buds blossom at our Milonga.</font></font>

say enough
about how great Valorie's and Alberto's teaching and dancing is!! I
still
keep learning from the tapes we got. The other day as I was teaching a
private class during which I showed the tape of your performing it
became
very clear to me that each step was being savored as one would sip fine
wine or eat a delicious meal. No rushing through to execute a figure!!
What a different attitude for us to try to comprehend here.
Underscoring
this is my body memory of dancing with Alberto - I would love to be
able
to teach leaders to lead with such gentleness and clarity!!</font></font>

seem lonely around here without having one of your workshops to attend.
I&#8217;m really full of exciting things to work on with my tango dancing.
I&#8217;m
writing you to let you know what a lovely experience it was to meet
both
of you, to receive your teaching and to dance. What made this
experience
&#8220;muy rico&#8221; was your openess, your excellent communication skills and I
guess most of all ,your willingness to make this a &#8220;hands-on&#8221;
experience
for us. Sometimes, in workshops, this doesn&#8217;t happen. You make
positions/movements
that might not have made sense before...click and one goes...&#8221;Ah-ha&#8221; -
the lightbulb goes on! Valorie, I really enjoyed the Wednesday class of
your &#8220;Tango Barre&#8221;, it was insightful, fun and helped clear up some bad
habits. Alberto, you are a wonderful partner and I love your style. I&#8217;m
so looking forward to your return and hope you had a good trip back to
home.</font></font> <br>

know how to
say thank you for your excellence and giving. The typical case when
someone
has developed expertise in an area after years of intense study and
self-exploration
is that they tend to dole it out selectively in small amounts, keeping
a reserve of information private, probably partly because it was
acquired
in private, and also partly because it is difficult to organize. With
Alberto and Valorie
the book is open and nothing is a secret. I admire the effort and
energy
it takes to do that. </font></font><br>

dichotomy&nbsp;
simplicity-complexity lay in the way tango is taught. I was struck by
how
profoundly simple tango can be after having taken a class from Alberto
Paz. This was after having spent a lot of time with another instructor
learning long chains of what ammount to figures, as if I were learning
ballroom dancing.</font></font> <br>
      <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size="-1">I don't think
the
regimented figure-centric method of instruction from ballroom dancing
is
well suited to teaching tango. A focus on fundamental movements and
positions
seems to be a more rational approach to teaching.</font></font> <br>

just like
to tell everyone what a wonderful experience the tango dancers of
Cleveland
had this past weekend of Oct. 6-11. Saturday and Sunday was a rebirth
of
tango for some of my students and especially for myself. After just 10
minutes into the workshop everyone was fixed on every word this man had
to say, you could hear a pin drop. I saw their eyes glued to this man
and
his partner, making tango look so easy and so beautiful. And in just a
few short hours I saw my students transform into people who's bodies
were
singing the tango. The smiles on their faces, the gleam in their eyes,
the feeling of acomplishment they just felt. YES, I can tango. Yes, I
can
Milonga. YES, I can Vals. Only a teacher knows that feeling when you
see
your studient learning and enjoying what they're learning.</font></font>
      <br>
      <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size="-1">This man
taught us
his technique of 8 body positions and the art of improvisation. For the
men finding the mark and then placing the women on it, Now my male
students
understand the fine art of leading and the women have learned to
surrender
to the mans lead.</font></font> <br>
      <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size="-1">I feel I'm a
good
instructor for the short time I have been doing this, and I'm not
putting
myself down, I just was taught in a different way. I now see a new me,
even more excited than ever to teach and pass on what I have just
learned.
I will be able to get more people to tango faster and enjoying it
sooner,
bringing me more students.</font></font> <br>
      <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size="-1">This man who
come
to Cleveland was not a performer, teaching us some of his fancy steps.
This man was, and is a TEACHER. I rate this workshop the best I have
ever
been in, and I have had some very famous people here, and I don't mean
any disrespect to them either, but this man is GREAT. You must bring
him
to your city. This man is known as the TANGOMAN, This man is Alberto
Paz
with Valorie Hart.</font></font> <br>

were
focused on improvisation. This was accomplished by starting with a
familiar
movement and then changing it in a direction not so familiar. When the
new direction started to become comfortable, then a different ending
was
added or perhaps a way to connect into another familiar movement that
was
not totally obvious. A great deal of emphasis was put on the importance
of the man &#8220;marking&#8221; all of the movements, directions, and timing
subtleties.</font></font> <br>

thank you
for the wonderful Labor Day weekend we spent dancing Tango with you. We

count the number
of workshops I have attended on one hand (with a few fingers missing)
and
I view yours to have been one of the most enjoyable. As a point of
reference,
the last workshop I had attended before yours was with a well-known
North
American teacher. The majority of the people attending this workshop
had
no dance experience whatsoever, let alone any tango experience, but
they
were eager to discover this thing called tango.</font></font> <br>
      <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size="-1">A few of the
participants
were there because I had persuaded them that it would be an interesting
and enjoyable learning experience for them. They were treated quite
badly
by the instructor to the point that some of the women were on the brink
of tears and completely discouraged from any further involvement in
tango.
I recognize that certain maestros in any field can be stern (Copes
comes
to mind), but this particular teacher's attitude seemed to border on
contempt
coupled with an ego suggesting he was God's gift to tango in the U.S.
The
experience was most surprising because I had heard people speak
approvingly
of this man's teaching, and he seems to have a fair number of admirers.</font></font>
      <br>
      <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size="-1">What a
contrast to
have attended your session! I don't know if any of the participants
were
absolute beginners or seasoned veterans, but you obviously treated all
with respect and in a way that encouraged and inspired everyone to
participate
and share in your love of the dance. This is the way to build a true
sense
of tango community.</font></font> <br>
      <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size="-1">Bravo Alberto
and
Valorie! Your demonstrations were clear, and your discourses were
immediately
relevant to the figures or techniques being addressed. It was a most
satisfying
and informative session for Nancy and me. I hope we will be able to
attend
another workshop of yours in the future.</font></font> <br>
