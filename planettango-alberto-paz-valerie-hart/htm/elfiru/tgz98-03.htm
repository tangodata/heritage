<h1>
<b>Winds of change</b></h1>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The Argentine Tango has always
been a reflection of the people who created it. This is not to say that
the music and the way we dance today has any resemblance with the typical
inhabitant of Buenos Aires during the last decade of the 19th century.
Every time we spend a couple of hours at a milonga, we are moving back
and forth in time, according to the mood and inspiration of the volunteer
with the CD collection and the time to run the music. As Pugliese is mixed
with Canaro, D’Arienzo, De Caro, Troilo and Tanturi, we are unaware that
we are zapping through a rich history of the music, the dance, the social
values and the idiosyncrasies of several generations of porte&ntilde;os,
the people of Buenos Aires, who as they undergo generation changes, reflect
those changes in the Tango.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The longevity of the Tango
and its resilience are founded in the respect and veneration with which
Argentinos see aging. As children, they love and are loved by their parents
and grandparents. As teenagers they learn to love and be loved by their
parents and peers. As adults they love their children and their parents
and each other. As they reach their senior years they love life and everything
it brings to them every day.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>That love is balanced by
respect, tolerance, generosity and patience. They let life run its course
as they first crawl, then walk and finally run. There is a lot of philosophy
behind all this and most of it is reflected in the music, lyrics and danceof
the Argentine Tango.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The backbone of the Argentine
Tango is the connection that exists between generations, adults and children
living in the same world, basking in the same sun and quivering in the
cold of the same night. Staying involved forever, and greeting the presence
of those who sit around the table every day and mourning the absence of
those who have departed. Children don't get kicked out when they begin
to turn into young men and women. In turn, when they become adults, they
don’t get rid of aging parents and grandparents. It is a very profound
commitment that enhances the quality of life and as a side benefit it allows
an orderly transition between generations.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>This may clash against the
beliefs of the politically correct crowd that fears to utter words like
man and woman. Instead they neutralize the human connection required in
the Tango by calling each other "leads" and "follows." They desensitize
the intense passion that men and women bring into life and that are the
key ingredients for the ritual of the dance. This attracts wolves wearing
lamb overcoats, who aim to divide in order to dstisfy their egos. Our communities
suffer.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>We are now well into the
beginning of a new 40 year cycle for the Argentine Tango. Where it will
take us, we don’t know. What the renovation brings us, we don’t know. How
we'll dance the Tango in the years ahead, we don’t know. Luckily, we are
living the process instead of recanting it.</font></font>
