<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The waiting was becoming uncomfortable.
For days I had been dealing with mixed emotions about a revelation that
came via e-mail. While I laughed and feared back and forth at the evidence
that somebody was calling me a <b>Tangofascist</b>, accusing me of being
somebody else and proposing that I be banned from an Internet’s Tango discussion
mailing list, I also wondered what kind of coward would hide behind an
anonymous username and send a defamatory message, full of hate and venom
to sixteen subscribers of the list. A few names crossed my mind, but I'm
not in the habit of falsely accusing anybody.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>It all started when I posted
the <a href="june-99.htm#Professor">interview with <b>Fabian Salas</b></a>
featured in this issue. As it is typical of the discussions on that Tango
mailing list, two factions formed to attack and defend the three more visible
representatives of the latest Tango dancing fad some call <b>New Tango</b>.
One subscriber in particular, using an anonymous handle, painted a rather
bleak and unflattering picture of the three “gorditos” as s/he called them.
It was shortly after that a friend forwarded me a message he and fifteen
others had received. He asked, <i>“I don’t see you on the recipient’s list.
If I were going to send such a poison pen letter, I’d want the subject
of my venom to get it. Isn’t his (her) anonymity enough to hide behind?”&nbsp;</i></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>My theory is that the coward
is not interested in letting me have his venom. He is betting on an universal
human flaw that makes some individuals want to believe in gossip and innuendoes
for whatever reasons they may have.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>You see, we are very visible.
<a href="personal.htm">Valorie
and I travel</a> and communicate with many people around the world. We
are open, direct, sincere, and honest in what we have to offer. For every
one who welcomes our friendship and affection, we really don’t know how
many feel threatened or uncomfortable because of their feeble tenure as
gatekeepers of good natured and well intentioned Tango communities. Unfortunately
they do exist, and sometimes their character assassination tactics and
their harmful gossiping make people wonder and change their attitudes because
of that human flaw I mentioned before, the lack of moral fortitude to come
forward and face the person being vilified by the hate mongers.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>At this stage of my life,
I can’t plead ignorance nor I can try to pass for naive. I just came back
from <b>Buenos Aires</b> where friends confirmed that “illustrious masters”
who have slept and eaten in our house, and who have made money and a name
for themselves in this country through our professional efforts, have been
trashing my name and questioning my motives for being in the Tango business.
<b>I
wear that as a badge of honor</b>. You know you have made it when you regularly
are part of conversations thousands of miles away and your name gets trashed
by the <i>elite</i> of Tango masters.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>But the uncomfortable feeling
that I mentioned at the beginning, is what really breaks my heart. Out
of the sixteen people who received the poison pen e-mail, seven know me
personally, some have done business with us, some have taken classes from
us, all have read <a href="firulete.htm">El Firulete</a> on a regular basis,
some have had free Internet space on our website. Only one was thoughtful
enough to make me aware of the situation. Only one had the courage to confront
me, to implicitly ask me if I was a "Tangofascist using an assumed name,"
by simply doing what I wouldn’t hesitate one minute to do with people I
respect and call my friends. He let me know about the anonymous defamatory
e-mail being circulated. He gave me a chance. The rest so far have chosen
to let me walk around with the stigma of a calumny hanging around my neck.</font></font>
