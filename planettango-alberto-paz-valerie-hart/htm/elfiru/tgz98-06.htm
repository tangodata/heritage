<h1>
An Overdue Recognition</h1>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>We have become so enthralled
with everything that publicizes and promotes the Argentine Tango to the
general public that we have failed to pay attention to a very damaging
flaw on the spin that is being placed on the description of the dance for
the general audience.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><b>Luis Bravo</b>’s <a href="http://www.forevertango.com">Forever
Tango</a> recent appearance at <b>AN EVENING AT POPS</b>, at Symphony Hall
in Boston was a major achievement. Now, in anticipation of the national
broadcast of the program, we read that <i>born in the bars and bordellos
of Argentina a century ago, the tango is described by show creator <b>Bravo</b>
as “a way of life.”</i></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Given the exotic appeal of
the dance, it would be easy to infer that Tango as a way of life means
to act and behave like pimps, johns and prostitutes. Sadly, some do; poignantly,
a notorious few carry out the beguiling practice of sleeping their way
to dubious fame with every willing visitor traveling under the guise of
a Tango personality, regardless of their age.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>This notoriety is so unfair
for the thousands of respectable, distinguished and passionate men and
women who, every day in every city, embrace with respect, affection and
enjoyment the ritual of Tango dancing. They are, for all practical purposes,
responsible for the huge success that the Argentine Tango is enjoying worldwide.
They take classes, buy videos and CDs, attend workshops, travel to Tango
events and support all activities that heighten the awareness of the Tango
to wider sectors of our society. Remarkably they do it unassumingly, with
the conviction of a true believer.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Unfortunately, sex sells
even if it is gift wrapped under the seductiveness of an exotic dance and
the promise of the ultimate experience. That is the price that a free society
has to afford in order to enjoy many other freedoms and choices. I suggest
that a cancer survives when it finds cells unaware of the ravishing consequences
of its power of destruction. The magnificent body that constitutes a Tango
community needs to exercise its choice to reject the pernicious elements
who debase the beauty and charm of the milonga as a pleasurable place for
social encounter and gratification.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><b>Luis Bravo</b> and <b>Forever
Tango</b>, who over the past few years have provided employment for hundreds
of dancers, musicians, technicians and personnel of all ages, while offering
a product of the highest quality, deserve the recognition and accolades
that the critics and public have bestowed upon them, not because some like
to portray them as promoters of low life bordello stereotypes, but because
of their sheer talent, impeccable work ethics and relentless pursuit of
excellence in the delivery of a production of the highest quality. They
deserve our loudest cheers and applause.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The time for recognition
and appreciation for the countless young men and women, middle-age housemates
and incredibly youthful grand parents from our Tango communities, who open
their arms and hearts to give us many very special "three minutes" of elegance,
poise, and charm in a setting of decor and respect, is also largely overdue.</font></font>
