<h1>
Just Call Me Charlie</h1>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><b>A</b> nation that lacks legends,
said a poet, is condemned to freeze to death. It is arguably possible.
But the populace that lacks myths would be dead already. This month is
the anniversary of Carlos Gardel’s birth. Since orchestra leader Julio
De Caro also was born on the same day of the same month albeit in different
years, the Republic of Argentina declared a few years ago, December 11
as the National Day of Tango. Thousands of miles away and witnessing the
first snow fall of the season through the window of a high-rise apartment
in New York City, we ponder about the severing of links and the lost possibility
of searching into the past that those who move away into another country
experience. The only memories of a snow fall in Buenos Aires date back
to 1918 and 1955, that is why poet Raul Gonzalez Tu&ntilde;on once wrote
about Gardel, "nobody has surpassed his touching voice, on the face of
a record or in the rose of the air. Perhaps, when the snow falls again
over our city, another voice may come close to match his". Betty, Julie,
Mary and Peggy loved his voice. They were the blondes of New York, "delicious
perfumed creatures" kissing Carlos with their "pretty painted lips as if
they were fragile pleasure dolls", in a scene of El Tango en Broadway filmed
in 1934. A year later Gardel burned among charred metal on the tarmac of
Medellin, Colombia’s airport.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Many believe that when he
died the myth was born. Of five Argentine myths (presidents Yrigoyen and
Peron, Eva Peron, Diego Maradona and Carlos Gardel), only the latter has
been accepted by all levels of society. While the errors of the other four
were never forgiven and their lives have been questioned and defamed suffering
the consequences of political hatred, antagonistic rancor and class discrimination,
all is forgiven of Gardel. Writer Horacio Salas points out that "in the
same way that nobody in his/her right mind would dare criticize the chromatic
qualities of the flag or the literary deficiencies of the National Anthem,
the cult of Gardel has elevated him to that same plateau". In many ways
the myth of Gardel identifies the common people of Argentina’s middle class,
sons and daughters of immigration. Gardel is the man who made it to the
top. He arrived. He conquered. All this in spite of an obscure past and
an almost impossible to identify heritage. The second wave of immigrants
in Buenos Aires totally identified with the French immigrant who grew up
in a conventillo, who experienced segregation, poverty and lack of shelter
like those who had to start from the very bottom of the pit in a foreign
environment and without a father figure. Through his voice, Gardel went
beyond the meager horizon of the slums to become the symbol of the Tango
song, first in the City of Lights and finally all throughout North and
South America. When Gardel sings, and he does it better every day, the
dancers stop because The Voice is reminiscent of joy, The Voice is the
wail that announces the miracle of a new life arriving to this world. Gardel
is born again in the soul of every Argentino that is far removed from the
source. Because Gardel is a winning attitude, a posture of arrogance and
conquest. Because he has elegance and class, with an irresistible smile,
a slick hairdo, shiny shoes and an impeccable wardrobe. Women loved Gardel,
and he never tied the knot, playing the myth and the legend to the end.
He was the eternal groom only married to his singing the way a priest marries
his religion. He created the ethereal fantasy for the women who fantasize
about the day when the idol will become Prince Charming and make their
dreams come true.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The twilight has overcome
the first flurries of snow; its gray tones are now pierced by a thousand
points of light. Soon the city will get ready for another night of Tango
on Broadway, an experience that seems to last forever. As the snow continues
to fall, I'll head for the milonga. Nobody may notice when I step into
the hall carrying Carlitos in my heart. They might say that it shows that
I'm Argentino by the way I move and walk. And if Robin, Jane, La Mari or
any other New York blonde asks my name, I may just flash a big smile and
coyly whisper in her ear, "just call me Carlos, darling, Charlie if you
wish..."</font></font>
