<font face="Times New Roman,Times">Living <i>la vida loca</i></font></h1>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><b>H</b>e could tell what time
it was by the sudden stop of the music. It was midnight in the USA, the
time for "fantasias milongueras" to go beddy bye. Another night, another
ocho. Tomorrow the sun would rise again.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The Cuban lady at the <b>Aerolineas
Argentinas </b>counter at <b>Miami</b> airport asked, "Fumar o no fumar?"
The voice of <b>Argentino Ledesma</b> seemed to pipe into his brain and
he began to sing, “fumar es un placer, genial, sensual," from the 1950s
Tango hit, "Fumando espero." "No fumar," he chose. To chose is such a pleasure,
genial, sensual. He stepped outside for one last genial and sensual smoke.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Ten minutes up in the air,
an Argentine flight attendant’s voice came over the intercom, "Now you
may begin to smoke." He smiled to his friend across the aisle. She proudly
commented, "I didn’t know you quit smoking." "I didn’t", he said. "I just
do it when it pleases me to." After a three hour nap, he got up and went
for a stroll to the tail end of the jumbo jet. He sat in an empty seat
and lit up. It seemed paradoxical that the farther he was from the land
of the free and the home of the brave, the braver he felt about making
his own decisions with a new found sense of liberty. Was this what they
meant by living the crazy life of an Argentine tanguero?&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>"Do you mind if I smoke,"
he asked the first cab driver he met in <b>Buenos Aires</b>. The "tachero"
gave him the look he probably had been saving for the first Martian he’d
pick up right out of an <b>Horacio Ferrer</b> poem.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The next day he had a date
with destiny. He was going to teach <b><i>El Chanta</i></b> a lesson he
would never forget. The snake charmer shoemaker was known worldwide for
his unfulfilled promises; the variety of his excuses; the originality of
his lies; the sugar coated con job he had played on thousands of Tango
dancers; the aromatic coffee and the ice cold beer he served to his customers.
<b><i>El
Chanta</i></b> saw him come in through the door and got up very slowly
without saying a word. His little chihuahua, a gift somebody brought him
from Chicago, made a shrieking noise and hightailed it downstairs to the
cavernous basement.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The shoe store had become
the set for a <b>Scorcese</b> movie. The two men locked eyes and walked
towards each other as only porte&ntilde;os can walk. His hands rose to
shoulder height, his eyes flaming with years of frustrations and emptiness
that excuses and lies had built over time. On this day justice was about
to be served. Less than a foot away he noticed <b><i>El Chanta</i></b>’s
fingers touching his chest. That's when he lost total control of himself.
Rushes of blood thickened his veins. He recognized the loud tie he had
given <b><i>El Chanta</i></b> a couple of years ago. In a sudden move his
arms closed around <b><i>El Chanta</i></b>'s neck pressing his bosom against
his chest. Puckering his lips he gave him a kiss on the cheek and said,
"how've you been, <b><i>Chanta</i></b>?" "Do you want coffee or beer,"
<b><i>El
Chanta</i></b> asked. "How about a beer with no head," he said, "I'm living
<i>la
vida loca</i>."</font></font>
