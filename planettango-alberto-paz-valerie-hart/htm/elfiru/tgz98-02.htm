<b>The Tip of the Iceberg</b></h1>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Like an unsinkable gigantic
vessel steaming across the waters of an inexorable destiny, some people’s
lives proceed night after night with a certain degree of complacency, trusting
that the sun will rise again and another day will soon be past.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Suddenly those lives unexpectedly
take a hit and a flood of shivering emotions begins to inundate their innermost
feelings. Dumfounded by the experience, they begin to sink into a gorge
of sounds and silence. The next day someone may notice that these people
have been hit by the Tango and have sunk into a deep ocean, their bodies
held in close embrace, sort of a dancing ritual done to the sound of wailing
instruments. And that Tango was just the tip of an iceberg, the visual
experience projected perhaps from a stage or from a movie screen.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Below the surface, the Argentine
Tango’s massive structure widens into an enormous density of musical, poetic
and traditional values that only those, who sink deeper below the surface
than the dance presents, can appreciate and enjoy.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Take for example the Tango
lyrics. They have chronicled periods of time along the base line of evolution
of a city and its inhabitants. In general, the Tango lyrics as a whole,
have roots in a medieval Christian concept where the female of the species
is seen as a demon-sent emissary whose purpose is to incite the men to
sin in sexual ways. This resulted in an antagonistic conception of the
human roles where the immoral female disdained and disregarded the male
efforts and betrayed him through infidelity.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>After 1910, the lyrics began
to show some tolerance, comprehension and even justification for the shortcomings
of the females. Gradually, as the medieval roots began to disappear, the
males began to accept the sexual activities of the females as a result
of their need to participate in them on demand, especially if their need
was strictly physiological.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>By 1920, the male writers
and singers were reflecting a certain lack of interest in spiritual and
material self-improvement as a result of an economical, social and political
set of conditions established by a capitalistic society where the distribution
of wealth was limited to a privileged few, who in the Tango sense, used
their power to lure decent women from their humble abodes into a life of
sin and excesses.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Along the way, the Tango
lyrics have casually been labeled sad and summarily dismissed as interfering
with our dancing joy. Perhaps, remembering that one can only see the tip
of an iceberg, we could acknowledge what most historians have said, and
that is, that the Tango lyrics as a whole, are a condemnation by the working
class, of the ethical, judicial, religious, cultural and political norms
and canons of a bourgeoisie society.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Fortunately, a renewed effort
is underway to disseminate and publicize the contents of Tango lyrics as
a way to understand more and more that flood of shivering emotions that
inundates our innermost feelings when we dance a Tango.</font></font>
