<h1>
<b>Of Giving Thanks...</b></h1>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><b>N</b>ovember is turning out
to be a banner month for Argentine Tango in this country. Take for example
the successful run of
<a href="http://www.forevertango.com">Forever Tango</a>
on Broadway which has already been extended until March 1998. Or look at
the sensational US Tour of Tango x 2 through many cities across the nation
crowned by a first class stop in New York City for the US premiere of <i>Una
Noche de Tango</i>, a brilliant production that pays homage to the generation
of milongueros that kept the Tango alive through years of fierce competition
with rock and roll and a frail economy that almost brought Argentina to
its knees. This month a constellation of Tango dance stars are shining
bright in the USA Tango firmament. Add to that the opening of Sally Potter’s
The Tango Lesson starring Pablo Veron, Gustavo Naveira, Fabian Salas, Carlos
Copello and Alicia Monti, and the soon to be released documentary Tango:
the Obsession by Adam Boucher, a young San Franciscan who spent two and
half years capturing the sights and sounds of the men and women of Buenos
Aires Tango.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>That’s plentiful enough to
be thankful for when the turkey comes to the table at dinner on Thanksgiving
day.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>But, in terms of giving thanks,
nothing comes first but our own deepest and heartfelt appreciation to you,
who subscribe to our passion and who share our emotions. Month to month,
without realizing it, we have crossed the three year mark and we are already
one fourth of the way to our fourth anniversary of publication. It all
happened because of you, who grew fond of El Firulete, (sometimes you may
have gotten jilted by controversy and heated debate, but you recognized
our commitment to excellence). In either case, with your support you told
us to keep it up, you praised our work many times, you supported our events,
and above all you opened your arms to us on every occasion that we had
the chance to see each other.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>So it is proper and fulfilling
to say “thanks” to you.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>This is also a good time
to thank all of those who have provided a place so we could all dance and
to those who played the music while we danced. Thanks to those who danced
with us and to those who danced for us and to those for whom we danced.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>This issue is very special
because it came about across three time zones, from the sunny Golden State
to the nippy North East. We are always obsessed with and dedicated to the
Tango and everything that and everyone who surrounds it. We believe that
the best way to thank you is by dedicating to you this issue loaded with
exciting and extremely interesting material that proves that the Argentine
Tango is a living experience and that both young and old have something
to contribute. Wherever you might be, we wish you a very Happy Thanksgiving
and many good Tangos to you and those with whom you share them.</font></font>
