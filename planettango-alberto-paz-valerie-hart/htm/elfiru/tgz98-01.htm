<b>The Three Little Pigs</b></h1>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><b>O</b>ne night PigNumber1
ran into PigNumber2 and PigNumber3 at a suburban milonga and as it always
happens, their Tango experiences immediately took center stage in the realm
of their self indulgent conversation. The subject of boleos, always an
advanced topic among P-types was brought up and P3, who's never figured
out why he has one mouth and two ears proclaimed his disregard for ganchos
as a “show only” figure. He had seen many gentle ganchos with the feet
staying on the ground, the swerving foot quite close to the standing foot,
and even some very energetic ones where the two legs stay together from
top to toe during the entire gancho. Pausing just enough to grasp some
air P3 winked at the other two and shared that the latter gancho can hardly
be said to be dangerous, and it consumes zero floor space but the most
noticeable thing for the audience is the smile on the follower’s face when
done well.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Visibly uncomfortable with
facing the embarrassing task to having to correct P3, P2 chose to tell
P1 that it was great to see him at their recent milonga. Yes, P1 had a
great time and he wanted to emphasize how impressed he was with the dancing
level of the followers up there. One could only imagine the musical crescendo
in P2’s imaginative, almost cinema verite mind as he saw himself being
the carrier of good tidings to the gentle followers of his community. You
know gang, he would write, you know how P1 has very discriminating tastes
because he does not ask many women to dance other than his steady partner.
P2 was sure that the tangueras would really appreciate this remark. Geeweez,
for P1 to say this, by George, it is a great compliment to our tangueras.
Mary Ann would shut down her successful law practice for the day; Mary
Belle would forgo taking advantage of the market volatility in the Asian
financial markets and she would also join the rest of the tangueras leaving
their successful daytime careers to party at Stinky’s, the fashionable
expresso bar and once a week Tango' s center of the universe . Perrier
would flow freely that night, and as each one would take turns to re-read
the news sent by P2, they would cheer, give themselves high fives and pat
each other on the back. P2’s imagination went on the blink when the eclectic
deejay attacked with Sally Potter’s rendition of Milonga Triste. The three
little pigs dashed onto the dance floor and proceeded to outdo each other
with extraordinary maneuvers and elaborated gestures.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The music ended and for a
moment the ensuing of ecstasy seemed to suspend the progression of time.
Mina La Fleur, who had been listening to the entire exchange, walked up
to the guys with the humble strut of a beginner. Excuse me, she said, being
a beginner as I am, I could not help but listening to what you folks had
to say. That was quite a dance, wasn't it? she offered provoking a smug
look on their faces. But I have a question though, aren’t you guys suppose
to dance with a partner?</font></font>
