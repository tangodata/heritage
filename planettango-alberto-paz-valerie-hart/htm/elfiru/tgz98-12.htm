<h1>
A Very Good Year</h1>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><b>W</b>e have completed another
year of our lives. It has been a great one and we can’t wait to start the
new year so we can continue enjoying the many experiences that the Tango
keeps bringing to us.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>This was the year when doors
were kindly and generously opened for us to allow us to meet flesh to flesh
with hundreds of Tango lovers across the country. For that, we are very
grateful to have had the opportunity to teach, practice and dance the Argentine
Tango all over the fruited land. From the paradisiacal islands of Hawaii
to the heartland of America, the essence and nuances of the music of Buenos
Aires resounded in halls, ballrooms, living rooms and converted garages.
More faces and names occupy our thoughts as we rejoice in the blessings
that the Tango keeps bringing.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>This has been a year of flattering
(and some not so flattering) imitations of the style, look and feel of
<a href="firulete.htm">El
Firulete</a>, the publication that you have helped forge into a fresh,
original and contemporaneous sounding board for all Tango happenings around
the nation. As we roam around month after month sharing our dance with
people all over, each monthly issue is conceived on the fly. In spite of
the accolades that we have received and the recognition that El Firulete
has obtained all over the world, it continues to be a friendly way to keep
in touch with our friends, a hard copy reminder not to take ourselves too
seriously, and above all a necessary quota of good humor, a relaxing way
to have some quality time to stop and smell the roses.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>It is also comforting to
return time after time to places where we have been and rekindle the good
times we spent living the life of the Tango. One of the great destinations
turned out to be <a href="reno98.htm">Reno in Nevada during the Labor Day
weekend</a>. We are already focused on 1999 and as many of you have asked
us, we will not wait until everybody has had their Tango weeks to pass
the word. We want you to make your plans now. As it has been in the past,
it will be the best getaway to celebrate your dedication and devotion to
the Argentine Tango. We are also itching to go back to Buenos Aires. They
tell me that the scene has changed over the past two years. There are some
friends who want to go together as a group. It looks like it may just happen
this way. The curious thing is that now we will have to work around a busy
teaching schedule that gets underway right after the new year when we first
fly to the extreme cold of Alaska and then to the sunny shores of Florida.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>All along, we continue to
manage to be in the Bay Area most Monday nights to greet people from all
over the world atop the nineteenth floor of the
<a href="tangotop.htm">Mark
Hopkins Hotel</a> for a very special evening of Tango.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Indeed, it has been a very
good year thanks to the appreciation and support of a great many Tango
lovers like you. That’s why as it comes to an end, we will have you in
our thoughts and our hearts when the strike of midnight on December 31
finds us negotiating the sounds of Carlos Di Sarli around a dance floor
somewhere on the Planet.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>To all of you, our warmest
and sincere wish for a wonderful Holiday Season and a Happy New Year!.</font></font>
