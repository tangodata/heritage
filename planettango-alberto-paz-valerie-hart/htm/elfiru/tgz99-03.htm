<h1>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">Star struck in Tangoland</font></h1>
It was a muggy evening. Shiny pearls of perspiration reflected the spot
lights t<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>hat hung above the bottles
on the back wall of the bar. The scent of a hundred hot bodies seemed to
take on colors of their own as they floated over the frantic pace attempting
to keep up with <b>Rodolfo Biagi</b>’s oxymoron tango <b><i>El rapido</i></b>.
Resting on one of the bar stools, he had an unobstructed view of the dance
floor several feet away. Next to him, she was in a voluptuous love affair
with a glass of cheap <b>Chardonay</b>. Her eyes took her deep below the
surface of the blond liquid and into another dimension which only she could
describe.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>There was something odd about
the way he kept time with the music with his tapping foot. At first it
seemed that he accentuated the second beat with a singular syncopation,
but then he appeared to lag behind <b>Biagi</b>'s almost obscene fingering
of the high notes by holding the full rotation of his foot around his ankle
for two whole notes.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Actually, he was thinking
back two Tangos ago when he was carefully bringing his partner around into
a half a turn. The later version of <b>Osvaldo Pugliese</b>'s tango <b><i>Recuerdo</i></b>
was being played. They were at the point where a bandoneon and <b>Pugliese</b>'s
single high note flirt with each other for almost an eternity. It was then
that he had been struck on the left foot by a flying shoe attached to a
frightening mass of muscle set on a gyroscopic trajectory. The shocking
pain and the oblivious attitude of the couple, that continued bumping their
way around the dance floor enthralled in their own selfishness, had left
him pondering about the evolution of his Tango dancing experience. He had
logged a few years under his feet after that first evening at the theater.
Unconsciously he had been nursing his sore foot hoping the pain would go
away so he could accept the overt invitation that was being glanced by
a pair of gorgeous blue eyes from the table on his left.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The reverent platitude of
their meditation was suddenly shattered by the crashing sound of the stool
next to him as it went flying. It was struck by a fishnet clad, shapely
and muscular leg. As in a slow motion dramatic scene, his eyes tried to
focus on the fallen stool; the stiletto heels of the black shoe; the elongated
calf muscles. A milky white thigh flirtatiously dissapeared into the long
slit of a sexy black skirt. Unmistakable Argentine round hips, sensuously
shaped at an early age by a steady diet of steak, ended in a slender waistline
that resulted from years of training. Her long black hair partially covered
the muscular embracing arm of her partner. At the moment, he could not
place the familiar body.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>He connected his thoughts
and he began to remember. A few years back he had sat on the edge of his
seat mesmerized and star struck by the intrincate tangling of legs and
bodies on stage that inspired him to learn to Tango. His companion at the
bar slowly took another sip of her <b>Chardonay</b>, held the libation
for an instant between her tongue and cheek and while deliberately swallowing
whispered in his ear, <i>"when you wish upon a star, also wish that you
don’t get struck.”</i></font></font>
