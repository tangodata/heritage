As a first time visitor to Buenos Aires, and a personality in the Tango
world and as a foreign woman, every person in Buenos Aires and every Argentino
I know here in the United States have been curious about my impressions
of the premiere city of Tango Argentino. When I was in Buenos Aires, the
question how do you like our city was constantly asked with a cautious
curiosity, as if I would answer in some negative way. Others before me
have had a fair share of complaints coming from cultural differences, about
the food to the smoking to the housing to the ways of social interaction
to the infamous Buenos Aires taxis - you name it, and it's been discussed.
My answer was, and is, always the same: <i>me encanta Buenos Aires. Me
encanta con todo</i> (I am enchanted with Buenos Aires, enchanted with
all). I loved the food, the city itself, the hustle and bustle (I lived
in Manhattan, New York City for thirty years, so I am accustomed to the
ways of a large and diverse city like Buenos Aires). The taxis were clean
and the drivers nice enough. I loved the shops and the cafes. I loved the
people. I loved the milongas, especially the milongas of the barrios -
<b>Sunderland</b> in Villa Urquiza, <b>Club Fulgor</b> de Villa Crespo,
<b>Canning, Sin Rumbo, La Galeria</b> in Boedo, <b>Juvenil </b>in Almagro,
<b>Los Andes</b> near La Chacarita, <b>Cochabamba</b> in San Telmo,
<b>Salon
La Argentina</b> and <b>Confiteria Ideal </b>in the Centro, <b>Club Almagro</b>
in Almagro and all the tango shows not for export.
<p>I loved the city by day and the city by night. It truly is a city that
never sleeps, even more so than New York City and Madrid. Of course, I
was fortunate to have as my companion <b>Alberto Paz</b>, who grew up in
Buenos Aires. I was also fortunate to have met so many wonderful people
here in the United States from Buenos Aires, so that my going there felt
like a natural homecoming. Most of all I loved the people of Buenos Aires.
I can identify with the porte&ntilde;o spirit, similar in intensity to
that of the native New Yorker. One of the most satisfying and emotional
experiences for me was that of the city itself having a palpable feeling
that it is the embodiment of the Tango. The very streets and barrios and
places are the music of the Tango. <b>Parque Patricios, Monserrat, Calle
Corrientes</b>. So many lyrics I had heard before became real as I walked
the streets that inspired them. One day, after a rain, I stepped on a loose
sidewalk paving stone, and hissing the appropriate epitaph in <i>castellano</i>,
I heard <i>igual que baldosa floja/salpico si alguien me pone el pie</i>...
in my head and I had to laugh with the joy of the common shared sense of
it. I felt like I was living the Tango. The other musical education was
in the milongas themselves, experiencing the unique ways the DJ's play
the music. Music is played in <i>tandas</i> of four pieces of music, what
we might call sets of music of the same rhythm. Purists would only play
tandas of the same orchestra, say an all
<b>Pugliese</b> set or <b>Troilo
</b>or <b>DiSarli</b> or <b>Tanturi</b>. But mostly, the tandas are played
of music, as famous DJ <b>Felix Picherno</b> explained to me, in the same
line, mixing the orchestras but keeping in the same rhythm. Between each
tanda a <i>cortina</i> is played. Since I know that cortina means curtain,
I envisioned the idea of the use of the word being an imaginary stage curtain
coming down and going up between each musical act (in this case the act
being the tanda). This is my own twisted gringa logic that I share with
you. I found many instances of words used in colloquial ways that defy
the meaning of actual translation, and I was always told not to ask why,
and just learn and accept the idiosyncrasies of Buenos Aires. But I digress.
The cortina is only played for about sixty seconds and it's a piece of
"non-danceable" music. The most interesting was a disco rendition of <i>Por
Una Cabeza</i> played at <b>La Galeria</b>. When the cortina is played,
everyone leaves the dance floor and goes back to their tables or to the
bar, and starts the custom of catching the eye, the choosing of partners
for the next tanda. Non-tango tandas are played too. The formula might
go something like this: four fast tangos (like <b>D'Arienzo, Biaggi, Di
Angelis, Tanturi</b>); cortina; four valses; cortina; four milongas; cortina;
four slow tangos (like <b>DiSarli, Pugliese, Troilo</b>); cortina; four
of the same kind of non-tango (we heard Dixieland, vintage Rock 'n Roll,
Cumbias, Swing); cortina; four vintage tango (<b>Canaro, Lomuto, Orchestra
Tipica Victor</b>), and so on with vals, milonga, tango, non-tango and
all intermixed with the ever present cortina. One would think that the
cortina would interrupt the flow or the groove, but on the contrary. The
cortina gives an order to the dancing and the sociability of the milonga.
It allows people to change partners, sit a tanda out and talk or drink.
Partners are chosen for a myriad of reasons, but one of the criteria is
how well you dance a particular rhythm. So if you're good at milonga, you'll
be asked to dance the milonga tanda; if your good at vals the vals tanda,
and so on and so on. Generally you are asked to dance the entire tanda.
This is great. For the first piece of music you have the getting-to-know-you
dance. The second gets a little more fluid. The third gets you in the groove,
and what can I say about the fourth, except that it usually goes to that
magic place of Tango trance time. After the high of the fourth dance (and
the physical endurance), the cortina seems refreshing and necessary to
bring you back down to earth. As with any person who mixes music for social
dancing, each place and their DJ take on a personality. The notables in
Buenos Aires now are the master <b>Felix Picherna</b> (<b>Sunderland</b>
and other places), the hip and charming
<b>Horacio Godoy</b> (<b>La Estrella</b>
and <b>Almagro</b> - THE place to see and be seen), and the master mixer
of the twenty something crowd adorable and gracious <b>Claudio Castello</b>
who keeps the crowd rocking at
<b>Regin</b>.
