<td COLSPAN="2"><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>V</b>ALORIE HART LOOKS out on the empty
dance floor, watching as couples arrive, a few at time. She reaches across
the table and grabs for an Altoid. "These are addictive," she says, popping
a bright-white mint in her mouth from one of the little red-and-white tins
that seem to be everywhere. Tango is a close dance.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Dressed in a glittering black shirt, fishnets
and a short skirt with a long slit, Hart keeps turning her attention to
the floor as she talks. Her dark hair is slicked back, cut straight at
the neck. Though her eyes look sleepy, her conversation is sharp and entertaining.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"With tango, you are either in or out,"
she says, turning away from the floor. "Family and non-tango friends don't
understand. My friends in New York thought I was white-slaved away. I sold
my business, gave up my apartment. But I did not really give up anything,"
she says. "I have a great life with Alberto. We embrace this community."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On the dance floor, couples move tentatively
in a counterclockwise walking embrace. Clearing his throat, Alberto Paz
brings the studied movement of five couples to a halt. "OK, now we'll try
something different," he says. Valorie's 55-year-old partner has an air
of grace about him that makes his maroon tuxedo jacket and white silk scarf
look comfortable, almost casual. "Like this," he says as he and Valorie
embrace, face to face, and move in exaggerated motions to the melodramatic
rise and fall of the music. Even in their overblown instructive performance,
their connectedness is unmistakable.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Alberto steps across Valorie with his right
foot, then brings his left foot toward her. They move to his right and
stop, shifting weight back to his left. "Go on, try it, try it," he says.
And the circle of dancers moves again.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Each Monday night Paz and Hart drive from
their home in Sunnyvale to share tango with everyone who wants to learn,
from the advanced, invitation-only crowd decked out in dark suits and slicked-back
hair, to dance-floor virgins in rubber-soled shoes, like me. As with many
of the people who are filtering into the room, tango has enriched, changed
and utterly consumed their lives.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Five years ago, Hart and Paz lived on opposite
coasts, each unaware of the other, wrapped up in successful business ventures
of their own. Today their careers lie abandoned, their lives bound to each
other and to the dance that brought them together.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Since meeting and falling for each other,
Paz and Hart have been an important part of a decade-long Bay Area tango
obsession. This is the hottest tango spot in the United States, and some
claim the hottest in the world outside Buenos Aires. On any night of the
week, tango-obsessed dancers can hit a milonga (social dance) somewhere
in the Bay Area. Homegrown teachers have sprung up to support the craze.
And many Argentine masters work their way through town, arranging invitation-only
classes through Paz and Hart.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The dance--close, passionate, sensual,
demanding a physical connection--expresses a side of the human experience
that Silicon Valley turned its back on. Engineers locked in a mental embrace
with numbers, theories and codes have traded sensual experience for platonic
flirtation with a machine. Tango, Paz says, can help fix that. "Silicon
Valley is populated and run by engineers, people who have a love affair
with the keyboard," he says in a deep voice that masks a distant accent.
Tango is refreshingly different. "The first thing you do is to embrace
a total stranger, keep your mouth shut and listen to the music. You learn
to listen to your partner, to know what they are feeling. It is a shocking
and devastating experience. These moments of sheer connection are important,"
he says, especially in a valley where people are increasingly alienated
and cerebral.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>D</b>ICK SIMONI, a Menlo Park architect,
sits down at a long table dotted with glasses of wine and tall draughts
of ice water. He moves a few glasses aside and puts his small canvas bag
on the table. His back to the dance floor, he pauses to take in a stunning
view of San Francisco's rolling hills, fading into the gridlike outer Richmond.
From the 19th floor of the Mark Hopkins hotel on Nob Hill, the city unfolds
in every direction. Simoni turns his gaze back to the table and pulls a
pair of leather-soled dance shoes from the bag, swapping them with his
formal footwear.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At the sound of tuning violins and the
sighing bandoneon, the Argentine accordion, people begin to mill about
at the edge of the dance floor, picking out partners, anticipating the
evening's first dance to the live band. While most milongas have a DJ,
Paz and Hart have booked Strictly Tango, a five-piece band, to bang out
Argentine tunes every Monday night.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Like most of the men in the club tonight,
Simoni wears a dark suit, his hair brushed back off his forehead. He looks
around the room, enjoying the view, the potted palms and wood pillars that
hem the dance floor. "We like to imagine this is a 1920s Berlin nightclub,"
he says. "Today in Europe, it's more underground," he says, describing
the warehouses he and his wife, Ginger, danced in during a recent trip
to Switzerland, as the band starts playing and the dancing begins.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The band starts with a stereotypical tango
song. It's the one that I hear in my head when I think of tango, a jerky
beat, soft and then loud. It has the rhythm of someone frantically sneaking
up a staircase--a quick run, then a pause to check if someone is listening,
then another burst up the stairs. It's almost comic, reminding me of Charlie
Chaplin's slapstick, until suddenly the music slows, becoming sad, almost
tragic. Even the fastest, most upbeat tangos the band plays have an edge
of sadness and tragedy.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Simoni points out a couple moving past,
their chests pushed tightly together, legs pushed out so they look like
a triangle. "That's miloguero style," he says, admiring the couple's performance.
The tight embrace and subtle foot movements evolved from the tightly packed
milongas in Buenos Aires.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A woman in a long black dress pauses at
the table and asks Simoni to dance. Standing chest to chest with the woman
on the dance floor, Simoni waits for the music to move him. Then, on the
downbeat, he steps away, tangoing with the others, adding his own slide
and shuffle of leather against wood to the quiet sound that flows just
beneath the surface of the music.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Tim Yoshida watches another young woman
whose arms are draped over the shoulders of a tall, older man. She stretches
to reach him, but the couple looks graceful nonetheless. "She's only had
something like three or four lessons," Yoshida says. "But she's danced
just about every song all night. She's hooked," he says with a laugh.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Yoshida, like a lot of dancers, talks about
two things: the sensuality of the dance, and something dancers call the
tango trance. Yoshida studied martial arts for 10 years before trying tango.
After three years of dancing, he finds it fills the much the same need
as martial arts. "In the beginning, you work on posture and try not to
fall down," he says. But once you get comfortable with the footwork, the
dance changes. "You are torso to torso, hand to hand. It's up to you to
lead. If you lead and she follows, you become lost in the music. You are
transplanted to another time and place."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Sitting across from Yoshida, Caroline Duncan
agrees. But for her, the spirituality gets wrapped up in the physical,
sensual nature of the dance. "With tango, you meet a man right here," she
says placing her hand flat across her chest. "It's a touching way to meet
a man."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Duncan takes a sip of her drink and looks
out on the floor, watching for a minute as dancers pass. Everyone is engaged
in their own world, creating their own steps. Some move slowly, deliberately,
with long pauses. Others stamp by quickly, swinging and kicking feet in
the air. Though everyone moves differently, the dancers flow together.
Always the couples stay close, never leaving the embrace.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"It's a dance for people who like to touch,"
she says. "When you first start a dance, you press your shoulder up tight
against them and listen to the music. You can feel the music, your partner's
energy. You can tell a lot about the quality of the person you dance with.
It's synergistic. Together you are more than two."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The dance, she and others say over and
over, got its start in the brothels of Buenos Aires. Some call it the three-minute
romance. Though it quickly left the bordello for Argentina's society nightclubs,
the heart of Argentine tango never strayed far from its passionate working-class
roots.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>T</b>IM RISES TO GET IN a dance or two
with the young woman. As he leaves the table, Jim Maes, a slender, bearded
man in a dark suit, approaches the table. He says a few somber hellos,
then crosses to the other side of the room, where he sits alone with a
full glass of red wine, watching the dancers spin past him.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Maes is a casualty of tango. Tonight he
looks back on his five years of dancing with a wrenching mix of joy and
despair.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Maes began dancing after seeing Forever
Tango, a Broadway-style show featuring some of the best tango dancers in
the world. "I saw it three times," Maes says. "It brought tears to my eyes."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Maes had a nearly instant reaction to the
show and the dance. "I know that," Maes said to himself as he watched the
proud attitude of the dancers, the tough stance and macho clothes. As a
teenager Maes had been a greaser, knocking around San Francisco's Mission
District. The tough, proud attitude reminded him of the street. The lure
was irresistible. He jumped in head first.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Maes would take classes as often as possible,
sometimes six times a week. "I fell in love with the beauty of the dance,
the passion and the power," he says.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Maes left his most recent job so he could
dance more often. Tango has taken over his life, and Maes feels lucky to
give himself over to the dance. "It's a way for me to express myself,"
he says. "It's been a long, hard struggle to get to where I am now."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">But now that pride is tainted. "The dance
is so seductive," he says. At a recent milonga, Maes' dance with a stranger
went too far--extending beyond the dance floor. The relationship with his
longtime girlfriend came tumbling down around him. Now he hates himself
for what he did and for what he has lost.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Yet tango draws him back. "It has brought
me so much joy," he says of the dance. "But it has also brought heartache.
I wish I never found it. I wish I could cut myself off at the knees and
never dance again," Maes says, looking at his untouched glass of wine.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Simoni walks over to offer Maes a sympathetic
pat on the shoulder. An older woman extends her hand to Maes, offering
a dance. He accepts, taking the floor. But he moves stiffly, his thoughts
elsewhere.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>M</b>AES HAS AN UNUSUAL dedication to
the art of tango. But for anyone to master even the basics takes time and
some commitment. Learning to dance well is like learning to play jazz music.
Tango is less about learning individual steps than about understanding
body position, knowing what range of movement to pursue from any given
position, and learning to give oneself over to the music. Like jazz, the
form allows an infinite range of personal expression. It can take a lifetime
to master. Women take about a year to feel comfortable, Hart says. Men
can take two years before they are confident on the dance floor. For me,
I think it would be longer.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As couples circle the room under Hart and
Paz's direction, she can't resist giving me a little help. With her fishnet-clad
legs bowed as if straddling a Brahma bull, Hart stomps away from me. Her
hands rest on her hips as she swings her chest back and forth exaggerating
a swagger. "Don't walk around like a cowboy," she says to me, a grin creeping
across her face.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"You want to keep your feet together, place
them right next to your partner's as you move," she says, grabbing my shoulders
and moving me around with unwavering physical certainty. "Feels better,
eh?" she says, cracking a smile and walking off toward another couple.
I am left to work out the rigorous act of walking with my partner.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Though we attempt little more than walking
counterclockwise, I feel as if just putting one foot in front of the other
is beyond me. But I am assured over and over again that everyone feels
lost at first. Even Alberto, who grew up in Argentina surrounded by the
dance, felt awkward when he took his first steps less than decade ago.
For the first six months he found the dance a trial.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Paz moved to the Silicon Valley from Buenos
Aires in 1968 seeking a future in electrical engineering. For the next
20 years he worked for small high-tech video companies, finally founding
his own in the 1980s. But by the end of that decade, Paz felt there was
something missing in his life.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">He began working at KIQI as a soccer announcer
and eventually as a night-time DJ playing South American music. Every now
and then he would spin a tango from the station's collection and the phone
lines would light up. The music brought back memories of home from listeners
who grew up all over South America, and they wanted to hear more.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Soon he switched to an all-tango format.
To gear up for the show, he took a two-week trip to Buenos Aires, snatching
up books and music, absorbing the history and culture of the music. "I
learned a lot of things that were already somewhere in my mind," Paz says.
"For the 25 years I lived in Argentina, I totally ignored the tango I heard
every day at home. I liked rock &amp; roll."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What Paz uncovered was a rich history of
music, dance and culture that was largely undocumented. At that time there
were no English-language histories of tango. The first was published just
a year ago. Even Paz, who tracks down the dance's roots with a disciple's
fervor, feels uncertain about many of the details.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Italian immigrants and recently freed slaves
living in and around Buenos Aires (which was a slave port in the mid-1800s)
developed the earliest form of tango in the 1860s. Paz says that the dance
may have originally been a spinoff of high society's ballroom dancing which
gave immigrants, penned up with little work and few resources, a chance
to develop and show off their grace and skill. Initially, most of that
showing off was done by men dancing together, because the flood of immigrants
was largely male.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">By the early 1900s, the dance moved from
the streets to bordellos, where men lined up to take turns dancing with
the women. The music developed an upbeat, seat-of-the-pants style, played
by working-class musicians without the benefit of sheet music. From the
bordellos, the dance began to spread upward through Argentine society.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Sailors took the form to Europe, where
it caught on like wildfire. And once Europe embraced it, Argentine society
grabbed hold of the dance, creating nightclubs and smoothing over some
of the raunchier moves. When depression hit in 1931, tango went with it,
falling out of favor for the first, but not the last, time.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A few years later, in 1935, musicians dramatically
changed the songs, emphasizing the rhythms and making it easier to dance
to. The crowds came pouring back. Tango hit its golden age from the late
1930s through the 1940s.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Though diminishing in popularity, tango
remained strong among working-class people until the 1970s, when Argentina
lived under a dictatorship. Paz, like most in his generation, just missed
out on tango. The foreign influences of rock &amp; roll were more appealing,
and the tradition seemed on the wane.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">With the fall of the dictatorship in 1983,
a show called Tango Argentino was organized in Buenos Aires. Many of the
old masters took the stage. The show toured the U.S. and Europe and helped
to rekindle interest in the dance. When Forever Tango came to San Francisco
in 1994, it was scheduled for four weeks and stayed for 92.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Now Buenos Aires is packed with tango tourists.
The government officially sanctions the dance. People around the world
from New Zealand and Japan to Germany and New York dance tango.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Inspired by his trip, Paz returned to Sunnyvale
ready to play more tango music. Soon he was DJing milongas and classes,
but he never danced himself. "I had the prejudice that tango was something
you learned when you were a kid. In Buenos Aires if you weren't good by
18, forget it. If you didn't know how to dance, then a woman wouldn't dance
with you."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">After a while, Paz learned a few steps,
but never really applied himself. Then, at a milonga one night, he realized
he was the only Argentine in the room and he was not dancing.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That night Paz made a commitment to learn
tango. Like so many other Argentinians, he was rediscovering what his parents
already knew.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Within six months, he began to think there
was hope. That was in 1993. Two years later, on a whim, he went to Stanford
Tango Week and saw Hart leaning against a dance studio door.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>W</b>HILE PAZ WAS discovering tango,
Hart was living a successful life in New York, running her own business,
oblivious to the dance that would change her life.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">One night while she was making a pasta
dinner with a group of Argentine friends she met through her corporate
event&shy;planning business, someone put on a tango album. An Argentine
friend boasted that he would teach her tango. But it only took a few steps
for them to realize that no one in the room could dance it. As with Paz,
the dance had passed these Argentines by.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">They promised to take lessons, and Hart's
interest was sparked. When she heard about Stanford's tango event, a two-week-long,
eight-hour-a-day tango celebration featuring some of the world's best dancers,
she had to check it out.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">She showed up in Palo Alto just curious,
not looking to change her life, meet anyone or fall in love. But then she
danced with Paz. "Not till I met Alberto did I feel comfortable dancing.
He produced a safe haven for me to dance," Hart says. They danced and talked
and got to know each other. At the end of the week they parted, keeping
in touch via email and fax.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Tango touches people at crossroads in
their lives. There is something deep about the experience of connecting
with someone. My mother had just died at the time I was introduced to Argentine
tango. She died young and suddenly," Hart says. "That made me realize that
life is short. I am approaching my 50th birthday and suddenly I thought,
where did 50 years go?"</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Three months later, Alberto visited her
in New York and asked her to come to Sunnyvale.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"I thought, am I nuts? I don't even know
this guy," Hart says. She packed her bags and left New York behind.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>H</b>ART AND PAZ TAKE the floor together
after an evening of mixing partners. The couple share a dance--slow, deliberate,
so close together that they snuff out the light between their bodies. They
circle the nearly empty floor as others look on.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The dance holds a deep meaning to nearly
everyone here. For Hart, a child of the '60s who has run her own business,
the issue is about fitting the dance with her feminist background.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"At face value, it looks as though it is
traditional role-playing--a man's dance," she says. "But it's not. The
man navigates the dance. In following, you get to improvise. The man creates
the space for you to dance in. Once that space is secure, it is a place
for you to express yourself, to experience the music, to be feminine."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Alberto finds the social nature of the
dance addictive. "People come together and share three minutes of true
50-50 cooperation between a man and a woman. The body communicates. The
man improvises and feels the woman's responsiveness. It requires commitment,
more than going out and listening to noise and drinking alcohol."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Both Hart and Paz dropped everything to
be with each other, and not long afterward they started a company, Planet
Tango. They publish a magazine, <i>El Firulete</i>, and are in the midst
of installing a dance floor in their home. They teach, broker lessons for
visiting masters, arrange tours to Buenos Aires, and sell CDs, shoes and
anything else related to tango.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"I'm living the life of a boho gypsy. It's
like being 18 again," Hart says. "We are poor, but we make enough for house
payments and to make a little pasta." The couple travels almost half the
year. In the next few months they are scheduled to teach in Honolulu, Alaska
and Florida. Every summer they take a group to Buenos Aires, all to dance.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"It is an obsession," Paz says. "You incorporate
tango into your life. In many cases, it's like a religion."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As the floor clears, the band packs its
instruments. Paz spins a few more CDs. A crowd watches from the sidelines
as the dancers from Tango show off their skills. Some couples dance furiously,
some slowly, with exquisite yawning movements.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The dance, which these people perform so
well, seems to spark obsession in everyone it touches. Casual dancers are
hard to find, and those who work at the dance are close. Tango, born at
the end of the last century, fills a void that has opened up over the past
hundred years. Once a release for the massive dislocation and upheaval
of the industrial revolution, it now provides a vital link to that remarkably
sensual world, a world that this century has left reeling behind it. Here,
at the Top of the Mark, as I watch architects and mechanics, attorneys
and students, lose themselves in the music and the feel of each other,
the dance feels like an embrace of the waning century, a retreat from the
gaping emptiness of the next millennium. Looking around the room, it seems
obvious that we will need to bring tango with us.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As the song ends, Hart walks out onto the
dance floor. It's nearly 1am. She calls out loud and happy, "Last tango!"</font></td>
