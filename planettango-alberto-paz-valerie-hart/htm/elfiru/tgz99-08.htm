<font face="Times New Roman,Times">Summer voacation</font></h1>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><b>I grew up with a belief that
the world was going to the end in the year 2000</b>. This was part of a
religious upbringing. I remember making calculations as to what age I would
be when "el fin del mundo" would occur. The more I grew up, the less I
paid attention to the possibility of doomsday actually happening, in spite
of witnessing a long list of lunatics from a variety of countries who throughout
the years have brought the world to the verge of self destruction. Yet,
the earth has kept on turning.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>So, here we are, enjoying
the last summer of the century, celebrating the joy of Argentine Tango
surrounded by a continuously growing number of friends. We happen to share
the exhilaration and excitement that the commitment to the dance brings
to those who love it. If the world were to end in about three months, who
can take away all we've danced this summer?&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>As a kid, summer vacations
used to be long, dreary, full of idle time and long hot afternoons and
balmy nights. Buenos Aires in the 50's was still considered part of the
Third World. For a while, after the Hungarians trashed the Argentine National
Team in Sweden, I believed that they were talking about soccer.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>For us, summer camp meant
to wander through the forests near the airport, eating berries and oranges
from the nearby backyards. Letting our imaginations fly, we would exchange
roles playing John Wayne and Buffalo Bill. During the early teenage years,
we would clumsily attempt to play Don Juan Tenorio with the neighborhood
girls. The thoughts of an angry father with his fists and feet ready to
protect the honor of their daughters, would serve as a natural deterrent
to the urges of the flesh.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>One summer ago, I lost my
mother unexpectedly and far away. Part of my childhood also died. For her
I was still the little kid that never grew up. Because of her, I was still
trying to live up to some irrational expectations. I'm sure she couldn't
understand that nearing the "end of the world," her son had gone nuts.
I had done the unthinkable, I had let myself be lured by the "temptations
of the night and sexy women." I had become a Tango dancer.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I wish now, that she could
have been to our milongas this summer. That she would have come along across
the country to see the love, respect and affection that I have received
from so many Tango friends. Somehow, I know I've seen her standing by the
door the night we celebrated La Mariposa's big Five-O. I felt her presence.
She looked so pleased and proud. Maybe she was also in Honolulu, Boston
and Providence. Certainly she must have laughed as we played like children
with friends her age in Harriman. Her angel definitely was in Reno, and
positively she is in my heart.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I write this off the cuff
as I admire the magnificent set of collages that Valorie put together for
this issue to remind us forever about the great last summer of Tango of
this century on this Planet we call Tango. I hope you'll understand the
indulgence. I wish that you'll share the happiness, the joy, the generosity
of so many people. They make possible the celebration of the Argentine
Tango as it prepares to turn another leaf into a new century. New faces,
new smiles, new friends will take our places as we gradually become nostalgias
of a great and joyful past.&nbsp;</font></font>
