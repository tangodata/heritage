<font face="Times New Roman,Times">Dancing to a Tango</font></h1>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>For over forty or fifty years,
the dance halls where Tango is danced in Buenos Aires,</font></font> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>continue
to enjoy a tradition that is widely celebrated by those who take pleasure
from a</font></font> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>night at
the "milonga." During the course of the evening and all the way through
the night</font></font> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>into
the early hours of the morning, the DJs play sets of Swing, Rock and Roll,
American</font></font> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Jazz,
Cumbias, Salsa, Tangos, Valses and Milongas. Each set includes four alike
rhythms,</font></font> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>which
the locals call "tandas." It is quite a treat to see the Argentines flocking
to the dance</font></font> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>floor
to dance swing to Swing, rock to Rock and Roll, jazz to American Jazz,
cumbia to</font></font> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Cumbias,
salsa to Salsa, tangos to Tango, vals to Valses and milonga to Milongas.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Like most of my compatriots,
I never took ballroom classes, and as matter of fact there isn't a single
ballroom dance that I can dance. Some of my best friends and a lot of our
Tango students dance ballroom. I admire them and respect them for their
grace and talent, and I truly enjoy watching them dance cha-cha to Cha
cha, rumba to Rumba, salsa to</font></font> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Salsa,
merengue to Merengue, mambo to Mambo, swing to Swing, fox trot to Fox Trot,
waltz to Viennese, American tango to American tango. I can almost identify
each one of the dances, even if as I said before, I have no clue as to
how to do them myself. I can only dance Tango, Vals criollo and Milongas.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>As a matter of fact I paid
for and took my very first dance lesson less than ten years ago. It was
a Tango lesson.</font></font>&nbsp;<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>
Ever since, Tango has given me the gift of love and friendship in the way
of the best</font></font> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>partner
I could ever dream of or wish for. It has given me the privilege and fortune
to</font></font> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>make everlasting
friendships and to share lives and homes across the country. It has afforded
me the unexpected luck and fortune of learning the structure and conceptual
form of the Tango dance as it has been transmitted from generation to generation
from the best. In particular, I profess a proud admiration and a profound
respect for Mingo Pugliese who taught me how to think and therefore, how
to dance to a Tango; how to learn by teaching</font></font> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>and
to teach by learning.</font></font>&nbsp;<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>A Tango can be sweet, playful,
arrogant, elegant, flirty, romantic, risqu&eacute;, enrapturing,</font></font>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>compelling, simple, complex,
sarcastic, sad, crude, tedious - you name it. It is the reflection of the
people who created it. As it touches me with its music, it is its "compas
"that invites me to dance it. Its sound enters my brain for recognition
and a vast array of emotions fill my heart in response to the stimulus
of a song. As I look for the unsuspecting eyes of a woman whose emotions
have been set in motion by the music, I just know I'm</font></font> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>going
to share the intimacy of an embrace, the nervousness of the first displacements,
the</font></font> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>warm breathing
that follows every step, the soft texture of skin as faces touch. There
is nothing like the shared intimacy of a sound, a scent, a gesture, a look,
a smile, a tear, a trembling body, nervous hands, a sense of implied trust
and respect for the</font></font> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>hundreds
of total strangers I have danced with, some of which have become dear Tango
friends, sometimes at the end of just three minutes. Then another Tango
plays. New and old emotions will be shared with new and old partners. Our
hearts harboring the feelings so we can draw with our entwined bodies renewed
dreams and promises to the sound of a</font></font> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Tango
on the inviting canvas that our feet caress.</font></font>
