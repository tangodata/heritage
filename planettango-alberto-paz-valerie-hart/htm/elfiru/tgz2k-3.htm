<font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Essence of the Tanguero</font></h1>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>First and foremost the Tango
was a dance back when the common people of Buenos Aires began to dance
differently what the aristocracy was already dancing in their stately mansions.
The music gradually morphed from the amalgamation of popular rhythms imported
from African roots, European styles and Creole influences. The bulk of
the population was made out of a chaotic mix of races and stereotypes that
made everybody suspicious of each other. Spaniards were considered the
purveyors of bad luck, Italians had a reputation as con men, and Eastern
Europeans were singled out for their poor me attitudes. Thet all flocked
to the Southern hemisphere at the end of the nineteenth century lured by
empty promises of a better life.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>This is what most historians
have agreed is at the core of the traits associated with the new generation
of Argentinos around the turn of the century in nineteen hundred. A population
with a high content of Spaniards, Italians and Easter Europeans was bound
to have a crisis. That crisis that plagued many generations of porte&ntilde;os
was one of identity and insecurity that turned into excessive arrogance
to hide inferiority complexes. That is what the Tango faithfully but politically
incorrect by today's standards, reflected in its choreography, its lyrics,
its music its various rhythms, and the life-style associated with it. From
that melange began to forge the Tanguero essence of the Argentinos.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Why Buenos Aires, and why
the unique sound of Tango music? Why a German instrument became the heart
and soul of its sound? Why people around the world embrace total strangers
and communicate in an universal body language that defies logic and reason?
It is the Tanguero essence that radiates from Buenos aires.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Buenos Aires was and it
is a city of sounds. The way the Argentine Tango evolved is a living proof
of how sounds influence the artists. Let's imagine a city without the background
noise of automobiles, trucks, buses and airplanes disturbing the precious
sound of environmental noise. Let's imagine the long lost sounds of the
clickety-clack of horse hooves and the squeaky cadence of the wagon wheels
over the cobble stones. The iceman, the milkman, the street vendors announcing
with bells, whistles and their melodious voices their loads of fruits and
vegetables. Somewhere, the push and wheeze of a steam engine, and nearby
the deep boom of foghorns carried by the winds rushing over the brownish
waters of the River Plate.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Let's seat at the rustic
tables of seedy river front cantinas where the cheap red wine is generously
flowing and the ghostly reflections of kerosene lamps project images of
long lost illusions. Let's hear the bells of vessels, the creaks and moans
of the lines mooring them to the dock, and the lazy lapping of waves beneath
the docks. These sounds inspired men named Arolas, Pacho, Berto, Villoldo,
Greco, Mendizabal, Logatti, and others with names less likely to be remembered,
to blend into rhythms of the street and into the sounds of a good times
town .</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Whatever the hardships and
crisis that the exploding population of Buenos Aires had to face, they
found joy and hope in the music that was before anything else dance music,
and that is what the tanguero essence is all about.</font></font>
