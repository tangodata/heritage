Contradictions and frustrations</h1>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><b>M</b>any things about Tango
and the underlying contradictions of the porte&ntilde;os are paradoxical
and they can lead to frustration if we approach them with the bias of not
accepting possibly complex codes of a culture that they themselves are
still trying to understand. It is the educated guess of people who have
taken an interest in trying to demystify the dense layers that surround
the history of the Tango, that the dance evolved over a long period of
time. Primarily, people from the lower social strata, more precisely males
with plenty of idle time on their hands, found cheap thrills dancing in
a different, mocking way, the dances that were typically danced in the
society halls and upper class residences of Buenos Aires.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Looking at this vignette
could lead to thinking that those who mock the Argentine Tango dance by
introducing "dialogs, conversations” and the juxtaposition of calistecnics
against any kind of music, may be the avant garde leaders of the new Tango
of the ‘90s. Ha!</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The guys who danced among
each other in times so early that no accurate historical fact can be found,
were rogues, scoundrels, rascals, low lifes who danced with each other
to show skill, deftness, dexterity, prowess, who used the primitive forms
of the Tango as a renewed game of "mine is bigger than yours". Dancing
among men on the street corners of tough Buenos Aires neighborhoods was
tantamount to the display of dare and bravado that goes on between gang
members in large cities across the United States today. As the city population
began to sprawl and the newer generations of immigrants began to send their
children to school, the incipient concept of law and order being good for
business forced the authorities to ban those street dances because of their
rowdiness and the bad element that they attracted.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Dancing moved into the houses
of ill repute as it continued its development as a show of virility and
a form of entertainment that marked the beginning of a form of Tango that
has defied the pass of time and the changing times in which we live. Men
and women embraced to meditate about their individual solitude and metaphysics
to the sounds of their city arranged in a beat of 2x4 first and 4x4 much
later.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>For a while, most men gathered
to show each other their skills and pass along the growing knowledge in
a quest to always be the best, to be admired, to be wanted, to be considered
beyond suspiction as a winner. Those who had a steady job, an education,
a functional family, learned to dance with older uncles, aunts, cousins,
brothers and sisters.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Men have not danced together
or practiced in seedy bars for over half a century. As the progress changed
the cobblestoned streets of the barrios into multilane avenues, equality
for men and women became an issue, a militancy, a welcome reality that
recognizes the values and virtues of human beings regardless of their gender.
Today, both men and women have equal access to practice and classes. They
both assume a shared responsibility for the quality of the dance. Trying
to spin doctor one hundred year old fairy tales to justify the cult of
mockery is to take away from meeting the challenge.</font></font>
