      <div class="copy">History doesn't keep records about weaklings. To name
Francisco Canaro is to name someone who represents the very essence of the
development and growth of the Tango both as a musician and a director. Few
examples of perseverance, dedication and passion for his trade are as evident
as in the case of Canaro. His legacy includes an example of constructive tenacity
applied not only to the circles in which he reigned, but also to the rest
of the community at large. He was a typical example of a self-made man who
rose from a life of misery and poverty with an uncompromising determination. 
  His struggle was primarily motivated by a materialistic purpose, lacking
  in brilliance and everlasting creativity. Somehow for him the end justified 
  the means, but the hefty benefits resulting from his hard work also trickled 
  down to the bohemian Tango movement of which he became the undisputed captain: 
  the fearless navigator that sailed through the troubled waters of unfair 
 labor practices to bring the rights of authors and composers to a safe port.<br>
            <br>
      His critics from the academic halls of the Argentine tango establishment 
  have been quick to point out his lack of artistic temperament. Francisco 
 Garcia Jimenez wrote, "because of that, he (Canaro) couldn&#8217;t introduce a 
single note of significance in the interpretation of the music of Buenos Aires.
He adhered to a familiar rhythm impressing on it an accentuated sonority." 
  In other words, no devoted purist would find ecstasy listening to any recording 
  of his orchestra, but for the rest of the world Canaro&#8217;s name and sounds
  will be forever associated with an irresistible desire to hit the dance
floor  because dancers were who Canaro played for.<br>
          <br>
     Canaro wanted to be a musician, and intuitively he was one from an embryonic
  stage. He lacked resources, means, principles and mentors to guide him
through   the scholastic paths of the art of music. What he had instead,
all around   him, was the continuous spin that emerged  from the popular
harmonic sounds   and cadenced dances that stuck to his<br>

through the lips and incited his sensitive fingers to want to join their
legion of interpreters. The rhythms danced at the dawn of the twentieth century
in Argentina were foreign by adoption, but progressively being naturalized.
Waltzes, polkas, mazurkas were quickly changing their original threads to
enter the vernacular prairie. The European waltz settled in Buenos Aires
and became Creole. Soon the mazurkas would evolve into rancheras, and polkas
into chamames, moving deep inside  the countryside.<br>
            <br>
      In Buenos Aires another dance music was cornered by a growing underworld 
  of disenfranchised citizens. It had been born out of the conjunction of 
various  immigrant rhythms. It possessed the evident genius and silhouette 
of the city demographics. The tango, music and dance, after a period of splendor 
 during the last twenty years of the nineteenth century had fallen out of 
grace in salons and family living rooms being held in disrepute because of 
its association with back room illegal gambling, bordello waiting rooms, seedy
bars and the irrational fear of the characters populating the dangerous empty
lots of the outskirts.<br>
            <br>
      This was the state of things when Francisco Canaro was born on November 
  26, 1888 in San Jose de Mayo, a small city of the Republica Oriental del 
 Uruguay. As a matter of trivia, it is said that a neighbor quickly noticed 
 the baby&#8217;s rebellious fuzz of hair and exclaimed, he looks like a &#8216;pirincho&#8217; 
 (a South American bird of the magpie family), and the nickname stuck to him
 for the rest of his life.<br>
            <br>
      What also followed was almost fifty years of uninterrupted labor for
 the  music and the tango which set Canaro apart as one of the key men of
the history  of the music of Buenos Aires.<br>

      <div class="subtitle">Dodging poverty in a crowded tenement room</div>
            <br>
      The Canaro family, numbering ten between immigrant parents, sisters 
and   brothers, crossed the River Plate and moved to Buenos Aires towards 
the end  of the nineteenth century. They struggled to make the essential ends
meet,  living in the extreme poverty of a tenement&#8217;s crowded room. Barely 
ten years  old, Pirincho took to the streets as a shoe shiner and a paper 
boy. Entering  adolescence, he first graduated to a thick brush wall painting 
job, and eventually  to an apprentice job at an olive oil can factory. There, 
the dawn of his musical vocation awakened, and with the help of a friend he
built a violin  with wood and an empty oil can and begun to play the makeshift 
instrument &#8220;by ear.&#8221; With the rudimentary instrument he joined other youngsters 
forming minor groups with whom they entertained neighborhood parties and family
reunions.  As his musical ambitions continued to grow, at age eighteen he
purchased his first violin, an old and beat up instrument with a sound that
matched its inexpensive price and the limited technique of its player. However,
this made his incipient dream about owning a real violin come true.<br>

      <div class="subtitle">Cradle of thugs and tough men</div>
            <br>
      The year was 1906 when he made his professional debut in a remote village 
  far away from Buenos Aires with a trio consisting of his violin, a guitar 
  and a mandolin. This is when he first made the decision to choose the popular 
  music of the tango to entertain those on the dance floor. We all know now 
  how popular and prestigious the tango would become because of his influence 
  in rescuing it from scorn and contempt, and earning it the credential of 
 citizen of the world. But first, young Canaro had to witness the worst spectacle 
 of human behavior at sleazy cantinas and seedy houses of prostitution lined 
 up along the dirt roads that dug deep into the guts of the desolate province 
  of Buenos Aires. A rigorous childhood and the daily contact with thugs, 
tough  guys and dangerous criminals toughened Canaro&#8217;s character. His music 
in the  beginning didn&#8217;t pretend to please anybody&#8217;s ear, but to keep moving 
 the swift legs of the rowdy element that made up his audience.<br>
            <br>
      His adventurous spirit constantly took him to the most remote villages
  in the province of Buenos Aires. He spent lengthy periods with the trio
playing  at dances and social events. In 1908 he finally left the boondocks
and returned  to set roots in the capital district of Buenos Aires, joining
trios and ensembles  that competed for popular acclaim with the likes of
Vicente Greco (Rodriguez  Pe&ntilde;a, El flete), Agustin Bardi (Gallo ciego,
Que noche), Roberto Firpo  (Alma de bohemio, El apronte) and others. He performed
at the legendary cafes  of the Italian quarters south of downtown by the
mouth of the river, today  known as La Boca. He established friendships with
Eduardo Arolas, the tiger  of the bandoneon (Derecho viejo, Comme il faut)
and Angel Villoldo (El choclo,  El porte&ntilde;ito).<br>
            <br>
                                               
      <div class="subtitle">Stepping up to the plate</div>
            <br>
      From the cafes of La Boca to Hansen&#8217;s in the garden district of Palermo, 
  well-to-do men mixed it up with the thugs from the arrabals in their pursuit 
  of female favors. Seeking the acceptance of one of those gangs, Canaro wrote
  his first composition, La barra fuerte (The tough gang), a mercifully forgotten
  piece that deflated his pretensions of being a composer. That did not deter
  him from continuing to step up to the challenge of his fellow tanguistas.
  With a limited education and unrefined manners, he resorted to using a
resolute   practical approach to test the ground where he would step on,
always moving   forward. The images of his initial poverty and misery drove
him to seek the  accumulation of money as his main priority. In that, he
foresaw clearly the  fortunes afforded by the tango as it captured the imagination,
heart and adoration of the mass population. This was also going to be his
ticket for admission to the higher strata of society where he become the
Tango caterer  de jour.<br>
            <br>
      Pirincho&#8217;s guiding law was to work; to work hard and to earn money
no  matter  how much or how little. He&#8217;d rather be the head of a mouse than 
the  tail of a lion. This led him to join his screeching violin to the good 
bandoneon  sound and the inspiration of Vicente Greco. What followed was a
successful  enterprise that attracted multitudes to the center of the city 
as the duo  made their way to hold court in Calle Corrientes where the tango 
would become  synonymous of the legendary street&#8217;s name. Canaro and Greco 
played to the  delight of the best dancers at the milongas of Salon La Argentina 
located  on Rodriguez Pe&ntilde;a, steps away from Calle Corrientes.<br>
            <br>
      It was during this period that the record label Casa Tagini produced
 their  first records, a milestone of sorts in tango history. Seeking a catchy
 slogan,  Vicente Greco coined the phrase Orquesta Tipica Criolla to identify
 the group.  This denomination, Typical Creole Orchestra, with the Creole
later dropped,  became the defining phrase to identify any group that interpreted 
 Argentine  Tango with authenticity.<br>
            <br>
      Eventually Canaro moved on and out from the shadow of Greco to join 
an  intuitive pianist named Martinez in a trio that began playing at Teatro
 Olimpo.  They soon converted it into a dance academy of tango con corte
led  by another  legend, Benito Bianquet, better known as El Cachafaz. It
was there when Martinez  wrote a Tango of fresh inspiration and named it
Canaro as a show of appreciation  to his friend and colleague. The name Canaro
flying  on the wings of a catchy  melody became a household word. Meanwhile
Pirincho  continued bringing water  to his windmill.<br>

      On September 21, 1914, marking the beginning of the Spring season,
the   students of the Medical School called him to headline the first Baile
del   Internado. These were lavish balls organized by the interns of the
city&#8217;s   hospitals. At the first ball held at the famous Palais de Glace,
Francisco   Canaro premiered his tangos El alacran ( The scorpion) and Matasano
(Killer   of the healthy, a humorous way to make fun of the medical doctors).
Sharing   the stage, Roberto Firpo premiered El apronte (The heat or preliminary
horse   race). The following year Canaro presented one of his everlasting
compositions,   El internado (The intern) dedicated to preserve the memory
of those outrageous   Tango parties.<br>
            <br>
      In 1916 the Bailes del Internado moved to a more ample venue, El Pabellon 
  de las Rosas (The Rose Pavilion) located at the site where today stands 
the  Argentine Automobil Club building on Avenida del Libertador in the posh 
Barrio  Norte. The pavilion was demolished after the carnaval festivities 
of 1929.<br>
            <br>
      These were orgies of excess to the beat of the tango. Year after year 
 the  pranks got out of hand and a few days after the 1924 edition of the 
Bailes  del Internado, a hospital administrator shot and killed an intern 
because  of a practical joke played on him. The interns of all Buenos Aires 
hospitals  went on strike and the yearly parties were forever suspended. Osvaldo
Fresedo  was the last headliner and for that would-be-historical occasion
he composed  and premiered El once (The eleventh, following the tradition
of naming tangos  written for each edition of Bailes del Internado) with
the subtitle A divertirse  (Let&#8217;s have fun).<br>
            <br>
                                               
      <div class="subtitle">A blueprint for success</div>
            <br>
      Towards the end of 1915 the tango named Canaro had achieved such a
popular   success that a promoter from the city of Rosario located a few
hundred miles   north of Buenos Aires hired Canaro to headline the 1916 Bailes
de Carnaval   in the second largest city of Argentina. There he shared the
stage with Roberto  Firpo and Eduardo Arolas with such a success that he
went back for the Carnaval  celebrations in 1917 and 1918. The friendship
developed between Canaro and  Firpo and their professional association had
the undertone of a cordial and  sincere envy on the part of Canaro for the
inspired composer of Alma de bohemio, the hit of the most prestigious cabarets.
Canaro&#8217;s envy also was aimed at Firpo&#8217;s successful recording career with
the prestigious label Max Glucksman. Towards the end of the 1920&#8217;s decade,
Canaros&#8217; primary goal of amassing a fortune focused on the emulation of his
friend Roberto Firpo. It took him five years to get a break, but finally
he moved into Firpo&#8217;s   territory at the Royal Pigall during the Summer season
when Firpo played  the Armenonville,  located in a garden setting that offered
more pleasant  summer nights for the crowds.<br>
            <br>
      By the winter of 1918 the Canaro orchestra became the headliner at
Royal   Pigall, and at the Armenonville in summer time. Here is when his
entrepreneurial   vocation began to take over his musical career. With an
uncanny vision for   business he managed three orchestras simultaneously.
One in which he played,   a second one led by his brother Juan (bandoneon)
and a third one led by his  brother Humberto (piano). Soon the number of
the Canaro orchestras were four  with yet another brother, Rafael (counter
bass) at the helm.<br>
            <br>
                                               
      <div class="subtitle">Canaro in Paris</div>
            <br>
      With presentations in cabarets, night clubs and other venues, Francisco 
  Canaro managed to cut a deal to take his orchestra on a tour of Paris and 
  New York in 1925. In his memoirs Canaro boasted about the experience as 
one  of greatest and most significant triumphs in which not only his orchestra 
  achieved international recognition, but the tango also reached a world wide
  diffusion.<br>
            <br>
      The truth is that the tango had already become a huge success in Europe 
  after an impasse forced by World War I. The music of tango ruled Paris played
  live by the resident orchestras of Manuel Pizarro, Tano Genaro and Juan
D&#8217;Ambroggio  &#8220;Bachicha.&#8221; At the beginning of the 1920&#8217;s thanks to the talented
pianistic  fingers and dancing feet of Angel Villoldo ( El choclo) and Enrique
Saborido  (La morocha), the voices of the Gobbi&#8217;s, a husband and wife duo,
and the legendary legs of Casimiro Ain, El vasco, the tango explosion in
Europe reached new heights.<br>
            <br>
      Canaro&#8217;s performances contributed to enhance the hegemony of the tango
  in all of Europe even when he received some criticism at home for dressing
  up his musicians with gaucho outfits for added effect while using Canaro
 et sa Symphony and Attraction Canaro to present his shows disguised as variety 
  acts.<br>
            <br>
      He claims in his memoirs that the attire and the packaging of his show
  was supposed to be a way to get around labor union regulations that blocked
  the performances of foreign musicians. So, rather than presenting an orchestra, 
  he was bringing in a show. However, according to brother Rafael Canaro, 
who  stayed behind in Paris at the helm of one of Canaro orchestras, the Parisian
 promoters wanted to impress with a genuine touch of localism to all of their
 productions, and the stereotype for everything Argentine at the time was
gauchos and pampas. To that effect, there were extreme cases where musicians
 were forced to wear their gaucho outfits on the streets from the hotel to
the night club and back, in order to add to the attraction and interest of
a cosmopolitan public.<br>
            <br>
      This honestly does not matter any longer. He was a hit in Paris. Meanwhile 
  in Buenos Aires, musicians Alejandro Scarpino and Juan Caldarella could 
not  come up with a title for a great tango they had written together. One 
morning  they saw the headlines in the local newspaper heralding the arrival 
of Francisco  Canaro to the City of Lights. That&#8217;s how the phrase Canaro en
Paris was attached  to one of the most brilliant compositions of the time.<br>
            <br>
                                               
      <div class="subtitle">Tango Inc. goes public</div>
            <br>
      The Canaro story from rags to riches could have happened in America.
 He  was the prototype of rugged individualism, a self-made pope of the tango 
 industry who was driven to success by the haunting images of poverty and 
misery he had logged onto his childhood memory.<br>
            <br>
      Once he returned to Buenos Aires, Canaro dedicated a great deal of
time   to recording hit after hit. By the time his half a century of artistic 
life   was over he had pressed over seven thousand records. On them, the voices
 and instruments of the best singers and musicians of greater renown have
been preserved forever as a testimony of one of the best moments for the
Argentine tango. Musicians of the caliber of Cayetano Puglisi, Minotto Di
Cicco, Mariano Mores and Ciriaco Ortiz. Famous singers Ernesto Fama, Charlo, 
Agustin Irusta, Ada Falcon and Nelly Omar among others, at one time or another 
were part of Pirincho&#8217;s orchestras. Canaro&#8217;s extraordinary vision allowed 
him to profit both financially and as an entrepreneur.<br>
            <br>
      He had taken the big leap from an obscure tenement room where he lived
  with an oil can makeshift violin to a trio performing in the boondocks
of   the vast province of Buenos Aires. He kept growing with the city, formed
 his own orchestra, recorded, traveled to the Old Continent. But he still
needed to do more. Without neglecting his prolific recordings, he foresaw
the oncoming changes brought by the movies and took advantage of people&#8217;s
new favorite pastime, the musical reviews.<br>
            <br>
      And if that weren&#8217;t enough he was an active fighter for the rights
of  the  composers and interpreters lobbying for the passing of the Copyright 
 Law.  His efforts were crowned when, on May 4, 1940 he founded SADAIC, the 
 Argentine  Society of Composers and Authors of which he was its president 
 for several  terms.<br>
            <br>
      Canaro had the vision of reinventing the musical comedy. From his long
  theatrical engagements he foresaw the possibility of producing a singing
 comedy for a general audience consisting mostly of middle class families.
 So, on June 17, 1932 he premiered the first one of many musical comedies
with the participation of top actors and actresses of national renown: La
muchachada del centro (The gang from downtown). In 1949 he ended the cycle
after twelve productions which touched on themes of the porte&ntilde;o life,
with Con la musica en el alma (With the music in the soul).<br>
            <br>
      During this period he associated with playwriter Ivo Pelay. It is important 
  to notice that a long list of tangos, valses, milongas, polkas and mazurkas 
  composed by Canaro with lyrics by Ivo Pelay were first introduced as part 
  of all twelve of those musical comedies. This also opened the door to a 
new  generation of singers that grew up out of the opportunities created by
the  various Canaro enterprises.<br>
            <br>
      He couldn&#8217;t resist the temptation of emulating the enormous success 
of  Carlos Gardel in the movies. However contrary to Gardel&#8217;s lack of concern
  for the incipient national film industry, Canaro was tempted by the local
  production of movies even when his instinct was warning him that this aspect
  of his business was going to be a loss leader. What&#8217;s fundamental is the
 historic importance of his work. His first outing as a movie producer was
 Idolos de la radio (Radio idols) an artistic marathon which included the
voices of Ada Falcon and Ignacio Corsini among many others. Paradoxically,
his last movie production coincided with his last theatrical production,
Con la musica en el alma, which premiered on January 10, 1951.<br>
            <br>
      He also played on the radio like many other orchestras of the time, 
but   this aspect of his career was brief since his plate was already full 
with   his many different excursions in the movies, theater and of course 
the recording   sessions.<br>
            <br>
      He died on December 14, 1964 but like all those figures who contributed 
  to the enhancement of the popular culture of Buenos Aires, his name is missing
  from the government sponsored National Week of Tango celebrations which
only  mention Gardel and De Caro, both born on December 11. However his creativity
  and his work were everlasting through many of his disciples as he continues
  to be an example of a vision for the future.<br>
