<font face="Times New Roman,Times">Like Guano on Asphalt</font></h1>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><b>Juan Semilla de Manzano</b>
had faced more serious problems before. He held a full time job as a VP
in charge of peanut butter packaging at one of the largest conglomerates
in the country. He had earned a reputation for analytical decision making
based purely on logical and common sense considerations.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>He must have thought that
his training as a peanut connoisseur would become handy when he decided
to become a Tango organizer in his spare time. Like peanuts, Tango teachers
had sprouted all over the fruited land frequently knocking on his door
in the hope of flavoring their bread with a few classes here and there,
while waiting for a generous sponsor with discretionary income to bankroll
the production of their next "ultimate" Tango show.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>At work, his heart was in
the right side of the bottom line. In his chosen pastime, he often found
himself buttering with the same flavor and texture the already sticky palate
of the dancers in his community. He was confident that he could market
any-thing.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>He was very resourceful
when it came to mixing the most odd ingredients as long as they would contribute
to close the sale and make it more profitable.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>He thought that the dance
business was very serious as he watched the high rated dance competitions
broadcast on national television. Professional dancers from all over the
world, wearing lavish and elaborated costumes have made a career of spin-ning
a theatrical parody onto many dances that have roots on the cultural streets
of exotic lands. He was also aware that tango dancers with lots of mileage
under their feet, exchanged a smile and subtly nodded their heads in sheer
disbelief, when the</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>"tangou" was shown on prime
time.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>He had witnessed how a militant
urge and an almost evangelical zest to capture and preserve the heritage
of the dance of the people of <b>Buenos Aires</b> had contributed to the
renaissance and expansion of the Argentine Tango into foreign cultures.
People</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>learning the essence and
nuances of this metaphor for life, could hardly be told apart from the
natives with the gift of Tango. They share a soulful purpose of inclusion,
and a passionate adoration for the exhilarating intimacy and loyal friendship
that the Tango brings. Others, who fail to get past the gaucho outfit,
the swinging of a whip and the rose held between the teeth, amuse themselves
with every possible gimmick aimed to mock, lampoon and make a parody out
of what the Tango, its teachers, its performers and its dancers represent.
They stand out for their reckless buffoonish attitude, for the abuse and
disrespect they impose upon their partners, and by their grandiose and
presumptuous delusional assumption that as cockatoos, they can dream about
the silhouette of <b>Carlos Gardel</b>.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><b>Juan</b>'s decision was
whether to sell, "chacarera classes," an Argentine folk dance that, according
to the resource-challenged "teacher" knocking at his door, "was lately
being played in most milongas in <b>Buenos Aires</b> (and a few selected
cities in the US)."</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>He knew the difference between
a milonga, which are the places, anywhere, where milongueros go Tango dancing,
and parties where shortage of skill and talent makes Tango dancing boring
and repetitive that extra amusement is required. He couldn't</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>imagine organizing <b><i>Chain
Smoking</i></b>, <b><i>Scotch Drinking </i></b>or <b><i>Coffee Drinking
and Making Whoopee</i></b> workshops, just because these things go on as
well at the milongas in <b>Buenos Aires</b>. Nor he had forgotten the words
of a wise man who first helped him step over the threshold of truth and
consequences: <b><i>"chacarera dancing, like high school skits, stand out
at a milonga like guano on asphalt."</i></b></font></font>
