<h1>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">Sweet and Sour Tangos</font></h1>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>It's been five years since the
"Year of the Milonguero" was "declared" by the head of the dance department
at <b>Stanford University</b> to herald the inclusion of real milongueros
for the first time in its memorable Tango Weeks. A new generation of dancers
was born during the trendy summer breezes of the <b>Palo Alto</b> campus
in <b>Northern California</b>.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>It wouldn't be far fetched
to state that the face of Tango in <b>North America</b> forever changed.
Although much of what the milongueros had to say at <b>Stanford</b> fell
through the cracks of inept translations, the impact of their humble demeanor
and their unassuming dancing captured the imagination of those who witnessed
and lived the fortnight of Tango during the summer of 1995.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>We get a kick out of running
into <b>Stanford Tango Week '95</b> graduates all over the country. There
is an unspoken emotional bond that binds us together, and a secretly shared
enjoyment when dancing and relishing the way we were initiated back then,
when the newly found embrace was a way to help each other not to trip and
fall down. The following year, <b>Pablo Veron</b> stated that he had no
teachers and all he knew he had learned by himself, infuriating <b>Esther
Pugliese</b> who had witnessed <b>Pablo</b>'s numerous visits to <b>Mingo</b>'s
"laboratory" in <b>Parque Patricios</b>. Pity those who are born dancers,
never had a teacher and can't enjoy the sweet taste of humble pie.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>This year there has been
an outbreak of sour grapes from a vocal few who after five years are still
looking from outside the window of the great Tango feast. They are physicians,
lawyers, engineers, and other allegedly educated professionals who dissect
everything wrong about <b>Argentina</b>; Argentine men and women; Argentine
food. They do it publicly exercising the anonymity and unacountability
that the <b>Internet</b> provides.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>It used to be that sitting
alone in front of a computer screen shielded selfishness, mediocrity and
lack of social skills from peer scrutiny, but a funny thing happened on
the way to the milonga. People travel, not only across town, but around
the country and into <b>Buenos Aires</b> proper. Males who complain that
nobody is friendly to them in <b>Buenos Aires</b>, declare that the people
over there are cold and unfriendly, and proceed to demonize Argentine men
and women, their eating habits and the way they dress or undress. Until
they reveal themselves as the maniacs who recklessly run into people, stomping
on the floor, dragging around helpless (sometimes hopeless) women in a
frantic mockery of a Tango dancer. Or they show up at a milonga with less
appeal than a door knob.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>After countless unescorted
trips to <b>Buenos Aires</b>, some grumpy females suddenly felt the need
to publicly confess that they can't get no satisfaction. It seems that
their bad habits, manners and selfish attitudes have become the target
of critique and suggestions for change from experienced milongueros, so
<b>Buenos Aires</b> is no longer the Mecca it once was.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Just as the proverbial fox
complained about the sour grapes, some complain sourly about their Tangos
for the same reason: they just can't get the sweet ones.</font></font>
