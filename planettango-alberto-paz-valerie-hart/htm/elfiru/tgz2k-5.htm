<h1>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another year, another Tango</font></h1>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">This time of the year Tango dancers become
aware of the existence of other people who, curiously enough are not Tango
dancers. These are coworkers, friends or family members who, full of the
spirit of the holiday season want to share the joy and the celebration
of another year coming to an end.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is a period of adjustment for those
who have been dancing Tango every opportunity they had. Being at parties
where the topics of conversation are just about anything people like to
talk about, and the music tends to focus on chestnuts roasting on an open
fire or silent nights of peace and love, could be unsettling for Tango
dancers who describe their pastime with words such as obsession, passion
and addiction.&nbsp;</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Maybe it is a sign of the times we live
in, the by-product of a society where stress and isolation are dealt with
with pills and alcohol, or in some cases with embracing an activity such
as Tango dancing the way others join a wide variety of cults. In any case,
the possibilities that Tango dancing offers, open the doors for a mixed
lot of individuals with very little in common but the desire to be Tango
dancers.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is a miracle that so diverse of a culture
as our American society is in terms of balancing materialistic and spiritual
values, that a selected minority of the population have chosen to adopt
the way of life of a segment of a foreign culture as a pastime of choice,
and a determining force to achieve growth and universality. It is amazing
that in a culture used to opening up a conversation inquiring not who you
are but what you do, some are willing to grasp the fact that Tango dancing
is what we do and who we are.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is an aspect closely associated
with Tango dancing that is still difficult to fit into the American culture,
prone as it is to competition and individual achievement which at times
dangerously borders jealousy and envy. We call it 'amistad' which is a
concept of friendship where being called an 'amigo' is a precious commodity
involving love and respect for each other.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Silly as it may come across, in the Argentine
social culture, mothers are forever brides and fathers more than fathers
are friends. The young are protected and the old are respected. Friendships
aren't spoiled by success or failure, wealth or poverty, good times or
bad times.&nbsp; Friends rejoice when they make progress on the dance floor.
Friends kid around as they compete to outdo each other on the art of firuletes.
They feel loved and appreciated when trading jokes about each other's whims
and mannerisms.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Friends, Tango dancers or not, are the
ones who once a year around this time, remind us to enjoy and celebrate
the accomplishment of having lived another year, and having danced another
Tango.</font>
