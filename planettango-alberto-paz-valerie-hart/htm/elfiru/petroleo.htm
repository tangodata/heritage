<hr>  <i><big>Each period of the history of the tango has produced its outstanding 
 dancers. Some become famous on stage whereas some others, no less talented, 
 evolved in the environment of the more discreet porte&ntilde;o milonga.
One  often forgets that numerous dancers of the popular dance floor exercised 
 a major influence on the development of the tango.</big></i>    
<hr>  <b><big><big>J</big></big></b>ust like the first generation of anonymous 
 dancers of the 19th century, the milongueros of the &#8216;40&#8217;s were motivated 
 merely by the pleasure of dancing and creating. They didn&#8217;t look for fame 
 and didn&#8217;t sell their talent. In the end, the contribution of these intuitive 
 dancers is an undeniable proof of the popular roots of the Tango. One ought 
 to keep in mind that from 1935 through 1955, the musical style triumphs, 
 bringing to the dance floor a multitude of amateurs. Salons and clubs multiply. 
 The whole of Buenos Aires is dancing. Tango leaves the stage to return to 
 the milonga.  
<p>  We will focus here on the contribution of someone who perhaps embodies
the  dancer from the barrios: Carlos Alberto Estevez, better known by the
nickname,  Petroleo. This individual who evolved in the climate of great
excitement,  is now revealed as the leader of the milongueros of the Golden
Age and as  one of the greatest renovators of his generation. Yet, Petroleo
never set  foot on the stage. However, thanks to him, Tango is danced differently
and  better. In one decade he modernized the Tango salon.  </p>
<p>  Born in 1912 in the neighborhood of Almagro, the young Estevez began
dancing  around 1927. The following year, he met El Negro Navarro, an experienced 
 dancer of the 1890&#8217;s, who entrusted him with the secrets of the primitive 
 tango. Petroleo (this nickname came about because of his fondness for red 
 wine) is determined to become the best dancer. Incidentally, he is not the 
 only one to entertain such aspirations. However, his avant garde ideas are 
 not welcome by his peers. They annoy, among other things, the traditionalists 
 who are still hanging onto the old style, orillero or canyengue. But Petroleo, 
 who glows by his audacity, will not let the hostile environment discourage 
 him; he will enrich his practice with a series of innovations.  </p>
<p>  The style most adopted by his contemporaries was somewhat obsolete.
The dancers  had not followed the musicians&#8217; steps, who had begun renovating
the rhythms  (ed. note from 2 X 4, to 4 X 4). Moreover, the posture of the
dancers often  seemed anesthetic to Petroleo&#8217;s eyes. Hence, he undertook,
with his friend  Salvador Sciana, El Negro Lavandina, to invigorate the old
figures. The two  accomplices spent their evenings at the Nelson Club practicing.
They excelled  in inventing steps and streamlining the figures. They refine
the ganchos  so well that they are attributed with their authorship. It&#8217;s
in the clubs  of the barrios that the two milongueros test their latest discoveries
before  they spread them to the milongas.  </p>
<p>  From the beginning, Petroleo had noticed that people no longer danced
in  tune with the new music that had developed a slower tempo over the years. 
 Since the end of the 20&#8217;s, orchestras played on a four (4 X 4) beat, in  
accordance with the musical renovations of Julio De Caro. Yet the people  
persisted in dancing on the two beat (2 X 4) rhythm. Anxious to adjust the 
 movement to the constantly evolving musical rhythm, Petroleo selected figures 
 that would enhance a more harmonious interpretation of the music by the
dancers.  The style he promoted is elegant, calm and always in tune with
the musical  tempo. At his instigation, the outline of the bodies straightens
and the  man embraces his partner with more delicacy. The finesse of marking
the steps  (ed. note la marca) replaces, little by little, the vigorous embrace
of the  canyengue style.  </p>
<p>  Gifted with a fertile imagination and an accurate instinct, Petroleo
authors  very pretty figures. He will never be tempted by flashy acrobatic
movements  that some of his contemporaries are fond of. Despite their seeming
simplicity,  his steps are designed with infinite subtleties and nuances.
He is owed to  have inscribed on the Tango roster figures such as sobre paso,
giros, arastres,  voleos and piques.  </p>
<p>  Petroleo performed with a rare vigor, the figures of his own making,
reaching  in the giros, unmatched virtuosity, Two years prior to his death,
he confessed  to journalist Hector Negro in Clarin, our new patterns, with
their visual  effects of a great beauty have quickly overshadowed those of
the dancers  of the 1930&#8217;s. People kept on inventing until 1945. Around 1960
everything  stopped. The birth of rock and roll and television, coupled with
unfavorable  political conditions announced the death of a glorious era.  
</p>
<p>  The venerable milonguero danced until the beginning of the 1990&#8217;s. Until 
 the end, he never stopped mentally making up figures that his tired legs 
 could no longer execute. He died in May of 1995, at age 83, leaving behind 
 him a huge and precious heritage. He has been until the end, a true example 
 of innovation.  </p>
<p>  At the dawn of the year 2000, Petroleo reveals himself as the bridge
between  the dancers of the first generations and the dancers of the present.
One  feels in the later, a strong desire to ascend again to the source. Professionals 
 such as Juan Carlos Copes, Milena Plebs and Miguel Angel Zotto have drawn 
 their inspirations from the famous milongueros.  </p>
<p>  At the beginning of the century, Ain (ed. note Casimiro Ain) El Vasquito, 
 played a first class role in the conservation of Tango as a dance of the 
 salon. Petroleo, on his part, exercised a marked influence on its evolution.
