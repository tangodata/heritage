<h1>
Good Morning America!</h1>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The exaggerated boasting of
some returning travelers and the generous eagerness of foreign visitors
have created in the otherwise private environment where thousands of Argentinos
cultivate the social art of Tango dancing in Buenos Aires, the perception
that the world out there can’t have enough of Argentino Tango dancers.
The sudden explosion of the Argentine Tango around the world has shaken
the fundamental essence of the personal interrelation of a man and a woman
engaged in a sensual embrace enjoying the beat and the melody of one of
the thousands of Tangos written so they could be appreciated on the dance
floor. The success of Forever Tango and Tango x 2, two critically acclaimed
stage shows, has captured the imagination of many people and inspired others
to consider Tango dancing. Unfortunately, these shows and the ones tourists
catch in Buenos Aires, do not have disclaimers that say, "warning, the
performers on stage are professionals and they have trained for years to
execute the breathtaking choreography you are watching. Please do not attempt
to imitate, emulate or try these stunts at home." Although you may occasionally
encounter an unscrupulous performer hustling students by showing off at
a local milonga, almost all show dancers in Buenos Aires show up at the
milongas to dance with that unmistakable look and feel of the well known
and the not so well known Argentinos who dance every beat and every silence
of the music with understated simplicity. While traveling abroad these
professionals occupy their free time taking ballet or modern dance classes,
they go to the gym to stay in shape, they attend yoga classes, they shop
and above all, they rehearse every day to be ready to deliver every night
a top notch performance. Many who have enjoyed and loved these performances,
appreciate the work ethics and the social manners of the talented show
dancers. They also value the increased awareness for the Tango these shows
create. Yet, in some American cities some aggressive women and some insensitive
men lie to themselves by professing a passion for the dance and a religious
admiration for that unmistakable look and feel of the Argentinos who dance
on the floor. Then they fall for the latest fad, they “ooh-and-aah” at
the latest contraption that hits the dance floor and they live their denial
by becoming amateur performers on the social floor.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>This can be very intimidating
for those who feel the attraction for the dance at the social level, and
annoying for those who are working hard on learning the techniques and
methods to navigate the dance floor, to develop a good and comfortable
posture, to feel the floor under their feet, to attempt to master the art
of improvisation, and above all to care and mind the person they are holding
in their arms. These are the people that are missed the most when they
decide to stay home. These are the people who form the core of the most
enjoyable milongas and the ones who deserve the best music, the best teachers,
the best dance floors, the best information and our deepest gratitude for
keeping the tradition alive, for letting the Tango change their lives without
pretending to change the Tango. When they go, it’ll be time to turn the
lights off. Then across America we will have more “legends” and “world's
most popular” hustlers encouraging an uptight and repressed society to
become Tango hot dogs. Please, pass the mustard...</font></font>
