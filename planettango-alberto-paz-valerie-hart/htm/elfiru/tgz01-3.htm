<font face="Times New Roman,Times">About loving Respect</font></h1>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Intelligence, oral articulation
and morality are what set humans apart from animals. That and the fact
that animals can't dance Tango - I know what you are thinking, but I said
"can't" even if it seems that some try. Certain animals can even exert
themselves continuously, vigorously and at times obtrusively to gain an
end. Such as a pussy cat that insists on being stroked when it wants to,
but gives you a spine chilling hiss when it doesn't.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>But no animal can match humans's
propensity to devote or surrender themselves to something habitually or
obsessively, victims of a compulsive physiological need for a habit-forming
substance. Animals don't drink, smoke or do drugs. Even sex is mostly a
reproductive instinct for them, devoid of the recreational pleasure that
humans can enjoy.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Tango seems to act upon some
people in the same way that habit-forming substances do. As Tango dancers
go, I&nbsp; hereby confess: I am a Tango addict. I get a high every time
I see or hear the subject matter of my addiction on radio, TV or in print.
I belong to a global community of Tango addicts. Most are passionate, socially
friendly, all inclusive, color blind and non judgmental because we all
embrace the essential tenet of the Tango, which is the ultimate connection
between two human beings celebrating the joy of being able to dance. We
call each other by our first names.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>On the benevolent side of
our madness, we welcome and recognize any and all Tango dancers no matter
who they are or where they come from. We share our obsession with passion,
respect, tolerance and consideration for each individual's right to choose
where to dance, how to dance, and whom they partner regardless of gender
or sexual orientation.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>There is a dark side though,
because many, who desperately seek the weekly fix of Tango dancing, risk
becoming pushovers for undesirably noticeable or showy hosts and organizers
who lacking social manners, play uninspired and mediocre music, and pass
judgements with a religious zeal. These tend to be the hosts of choice
for some "star teachers" who ameliorate their contempt for the addicts
with obscene increases of their private class fees. There might be a correlation
between how much of a pushover someone becomes by the skyrocketing amount
of money they pay for a private lesson. Three figures seem to be the point
when someone might be certified as pathetic without hope.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>But what is great about the
habit-forming effects of Tango dancing, is that it is actually therapeutic.
It softens the heart. It stimulates circulation of the blood. It strokes
the soul in preparation for eternal bliss. It exercises the heart with
unsolicited acts of love and kindness. Yet, there are times when the going
gets tough, and those who resort to slanderous lies, shabby calumny and
deceitful business practices in order to exert undue influence in promoting
their own agenda can be very harmful.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Fortunately, what sets us
apart from the animal kingdom, is that we don't have to lick the hand that
slaps us. We are afforded the moral fortitude, the use of our intelligence,
and the power to decide how far our individual and communal self-respect
and self-esteem must take a back seat to lunatic discourses, fanatical
ranting and offensive behavior. It's our choice to walk away and seek people
and places where our surrendering to the blissful obsession of the Tango
is framed within the context of a loving respect for the music, the dance,
the dancers and ourselves.</font></font>
