Tango Browsing and Dancing Modems</h1>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I always find it rewarding when
friends show a genuine interest in what is underneath the unexplainable
attraction we feel towards the Argentine Tango. And I mean not just the
dance but the music, the poetry and all the accumulated life experiences
of men and women who never imagined that their popular cultural expressions
would prove <b>Borges</b> wrong, and instead of being relegated to being
museum pieces, they would occupy a very important aspect in the lives of
thousands of people around the world.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>It happened on one of those
overcast mornings when class was ending. Curiosity may have caused somebody
to poke around the CD pile and fate did the rest. Suddenly it was the voice
of <b>Carlos Dante</b> asking <i>where are you going wearing a shawl from
Manila, where are you going wearing such a pretty costume...? </i>and the
unmistakable sound of the <b>Alfredo De Angelis
</b>orchestra. The Tango
is
called <b><i>Carnaval</i></b> and deals with the ingratitude of someone
who quickly forgot friends and loved ones after finding a wealthier companion.
My late father used to sing it all the time. I guess it was very popular
at the time. As a matter of fact <b>De Angelis</b> is credited by many
as being indirectly responsible for their being born.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Yes, in the late forties
and early fifties, the neighborhood clubs, especially at carnaval time,
were the place for boys and girls to meet and flirt. The setting was a
huge gymnasium dressed for the occasion with festive decorations. The music
was equal shares of Tango and Jazz. The orchestra of <b>Alfredo De Angelis</b>
with the voices of <b>Julio Martel </b>and <b>Carlos Dante</b> was hot,
and people traveled just to dance to their music. Much later when the budding
carnaval romances ended up in marriage, countless love makings and conceptions
took place while <b>De Angelis</b> was playing on the radio. Now the imagery
pops in living color and full of emotion.. <i>A gray winter afternoon in
Buenos Aires, the long bus ride sitting next to dad. Dusk is settling in.
<b>Calle
Corrientes</b> wakes up with a big yawn of noises and neon. <b>Calle Florida</b>
is busy carrying serious men and women back and forth</i>.
<b><i>Calle
Maipu, Radio El Mundo, El Glostora Tango Club, Alfredo De Angelis, La pastora
and her tra-la-ra-la-ra!</i></b></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>If it is true that in our
mind we keep a record of every feeling and emotion we have experienced
from the day that we were born, I must have run into some very old recordings
which I did not even know I had. What is so great about these recordings
is that they are stored with sound, images, feelings and emotions. Yes,
a mind boggling piece of biological engineering, the kind of browser not
even <b>Bill Gates</b> can figure out. Not that engineers and scientists
have not attempted to rationalize feelings and emotions. Just listen in
on any Internet Tango related conversations. Well, maybe don’t, because
you too may be tempted to become a Tango browser. Soon you’ll be dancing
by modem.</font></font>
