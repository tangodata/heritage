<h1>
Summertime Blues</h1>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><b>G</b>rowing up in Buenos
Aires, one gets used to the onset of winter during the month of July. The
days are gray, the wind is unrelenting and the consumption of cold medicine
becomes a national pastime. Winter is very cruel on the poor and destitute.
As cruel as the catchy slogan "we have to make it through Winter," coined
during one of the many economical crisis that the people of Argentina had
to endure, by a government official nicknamed The Pig by the people.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Our vision of the world and
the life we live is acutely shaped by the amenities of the parental bubble
in which we bloom from helpless little “stinkers” to fearless wanderers
of a future we hardly know. For years after I left my parents' home and
the neighborhood where I grew up, I kept looking forward to September as
a sign that another Winter had gone by and everyone I loved and cared for,
had made it through alive and well.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Then July became an inconsequential
month of Summer up until three years ago when the curiosity for finding
out what people did for five consecutive days, eight hours a day during
a Tango Week, became a self-indulgent vacation which I allowed myself to
take in the wake of the most difficult period of my life. In an incredible
turn of events my life changed, better yet, I found my life. I tore up
the psychological mortgage that had burdened an existence molded under
the prejudices of the past. In the process, new friends and relationships
enhanced a new found purpose for living.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Amid the renewal of old friendships
and the making of new ones, this July became once more a joyful time to
celebrate the joy and passion of the Argentine Tango, to discuss the pros
and cons of interactive lead and follow and to ponder whether it is important
in Tango to tell the boys from the girls.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Then suddenly, the grim ghost
of a faraway Winter chilled the air with the incomprehensible news of my
mother’s death. Her eyes closed for the last time and the world kept on
going. Like in every aspect of our life, somebody, somewhere, sometime
had expressed what it feels like when such a loss occurs; more than ever
I felt fortunate to know that somewhere in Buenos Aires somebody was a
Tango poet, and sometime in the past he wrote the words to songs that became
the lullabies my mother hummed to cradle her little boy to sleep. But I
did not grab the guitar and start singing “my poor dear mother, how many
headaches I gave her,” nor did I feel compelled to sing how sorry I was
for going away to live my life. Instead, I listened to many of the tunes
she used to hum. I tried to bring to mind the time when we danced a Tango,
when I didn’t have a clue and I couldn’t even begin to imagine that forty
some years in the future, dancing Tango would be a way of life for me.
She couldn’t understand it a year ago. Like most parents from her time
she thought of Tango as the gate to the wrong life. But I know that she
could sense that she’d never seen me as happy as I am.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I don’t quite know how to
handle the sudden blues that summer time has brought, but those who showed
their sympathy and gave me a hug, have made me think that when it is too
late to say the words we could’ve said and there is nothing else to give,
all that is left, is the overflow of tears.</font></font>
