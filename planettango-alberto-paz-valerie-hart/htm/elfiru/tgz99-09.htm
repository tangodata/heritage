<font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Gift of Tango</font></h1>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><b>Standing in the living room</b>,
we formed a circle and held hands. One by one we introduced ourselves.
Some came from Texas, others from Chicago. Then there were the hosts, the
family who owned the farm surrounding the home where the ritual was taking
place. We were from California, and the words "traveling Tango teachers"
sounded awkward and somehow out of context with the spirit of the moment.
Suddenly, and all at once, they began to sing a harmonious hymn that filled
the room with sounds of purity, love and a heartfelt appreciation for the
joy of being alive, surrounded by friends and family. Then, we sat down
at the dinner table and celebrated Thanksgiving in the heartland of America.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>We've been traveling quite
a lot embracing our chosen vocation of preserving and fostering the development
of new and established Argentine Tango communities. We bring along our
passionate love and dedication for the music, poetry and dance, empowering
the force of knowledge to free the minds, to encourage the bodies to accept
the closeness of other bodies for engaging in enjoyment of the music and
joyful sharing of the dance. Returning to places we have been, where the
Argentine Tango already has a established presence, we have also discovered
new fledging hamlets. There, the desire to dance the Tango is only surpassed
by the energy and passion with which the people go out of their way to
reach out, grasping as much Tango as is humanly possible.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In retrospect, our intuition,
our confidence and our faith in people has allowed us to establish a presence
for the Tango as far north as the city of Anchorage in Alaska, and as deep
in the south as the city of New Orleans. Along the way, we met great people
in Winnipeg, Canada, and found ourselves a family in the heartland of America.
So, when Thanksgiving caught us wandering through the prairie, we never
felt away from home. We never paused to question what does a traveling
Tango teacher do when the moan of the bandoneon and the whine of the violin,
are replaced by the call of the turkey on Thanksgiving day .&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>We found ourselves holding
hands with our new friends and their families, saying grace and feeling
thankful that our lives are so blessed with the gift of Tango. We are thankful
for the possibility of sharing that gift with warm, gentle, generous and
caring human beings who had morphed from total strangers to affectionate
friends in the brief time it takes to embrace and walk a few times around
the dance floor.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>This is the kind of rewarding
experience that reminds us about the quality of life that Argentine Tango
can bring to those who dare to be close. There is nothing like the shared
intimacy of a sound, a scent, a gesture, a look, a smile, a tear. Intense
moments that soothe the soul, energize the heart and make us feel alive,
vibrant, inspired, and above all thankful. We have connected, we have made
an everlasting impression, and there is a part of us that forever will
be special. Step by step we keep navigating the dance floor of life. As
we go around, there is always something or somebody who reminds us how
important it is to be at peace with ourselves, to give each other the gift
of Tango, to hold hands, to embrace, to love the music, to absorb the culture,
to teach by learning and to learn by teaching.</font></font>
