<font face="Times New Roman,Times">Four Crazy Days</font></h1>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Back a few decades ago, in the
city of Buenos Aires at carnaval time, we used to sing along with a catchy
tune that reflected the spirit and the purpose of the celebration we were
all engaged in just before the period of Lent, a mandatory time of fasting
and abstinence for a devoted Catholic population.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>For four crazy days you're
going to live, for four crazy days you're going to have some fun. The four
days included the Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday before Ash Wednesday,
the official day that initiates a religious ritual that ends on Easter
Sunday. Growing up in the streets of the Silver Queen, we looked forward
to the four days of carnaval..</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The celebration of carnaval
was a time of the year when we let go of inhibitions and took to the streets
to dance, parade and become part of a masked crowd that moved about the
city engulfed in a cacophony of drums, chants and popular tunes. It was
all about coming out.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>As it happened for our parents'
and grandparents' generations, all the popular social clubs offered the
possibility to dance to the greatest orchestras of that time. The announcements
filled full pages in the newspapers. Posters, flyers and hand bills were
all over the city walls and sidewalks. In retrospect, the choices were
overwhelming. Anibal Troilo in Avellaneda at the Racing Club. Osvaldo Pugliese
in Atlanta at Villa Crespo. Juan D’Arienzo at Club Atletico Boca Juniors.
Carlos Di Sarli at Velez Sarfield. Francisco Canaro at the Luna Park. Or
was it the other way around? It really doesn’t matter, because at the time
all of that was part of a natural cycle of our life. It happened. Carnaval
was the time to venture out and it was the greatest time to be young and
bold at the end of summer in Buenos Aires.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>For it was not just the
appeal of the orchestra which led many to the gigantic dance floors, but
the call of nature for men and women to openly seek each other out, free
of the traditional codes of conduct otherwise imposed by a zealous society.
Carnaval was the time when eyes were the first contact to acknowledge each
other’s presence, to encourage the shy to be daring, to reassure the undecided
to take a chance, to openly express the feeling of attraction. For four
crazy days, codes and protocols were set aside. Four crazy days that invited
one to live. It was time for fun, joy and romance to the sounds of the
Tango.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The same Tango we dance
and love today, thousands of miles away from the source, in our adopted
American homeland. The same Tango that, because of early Hollywood types
like Rudolph Valentino, symbols like the rose between the teeth, and the
staged choreographies of Tango shows for export, seems to be muffled by
a chatter of false pretenses and corny cliches.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>So, I never dreamed that
in the first carnaval of the twenty-first century, our journey through
the Tango life would lead us to a city where the spirit of carnaval, according
to spotty records, seems to date back to 1781.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>That New Orleans, the Crescent
City, is part of the United States baffles a visitor's mind. Long after
the city was acquired as part of the Louisiana Purchase, traces of nobility,
aristocracy and the diversity of races, languages and cultural traits seem
to preserve the rituals of celebration of the greatest free show on earth.
They call it Mardi Gras, but it is carnaval minus Tango. Or so it was until
now.</font></font>
