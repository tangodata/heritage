<b>The Tango Lesson</b></h1>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>She walked into the club with
the typical apprehension of a newcomer and with a body language that betrayed
her efforts to make herself feel comfortable at the unknown milonga.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The hostess did not help
the cause by looking inquisitive and unfriendly, like wondering why a good
looking woman who nobody knew just walked in from the street and into the
cliquish milonga. Nevertheless she paid her admission and walked around
the floor to find a lonely chair at an empty table. She sat and proceeded
to stare at the dancers who oblivious to her presence where going about
the business of exercising their various levels of skills to the beat of
a Tango.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Nearby the TangoMan stood
by scanning the scene with his eyes looking to make contact with one of
the many females who sat around the dance floor, some engaged in chit chat
with their neighbors at the table, others staring at the floor or enthralled
in some fantasy dream that kept their eyes focused into a foggy space they
only knew it existed.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The time went by three minutes
at a time with the sounds of Troilo, Pugliese, D'Arienzo. The room was
lit enough for the ritual to take place. Man asking for the assurance that
the woman wants to dance. Man trying to catch the eye, to invite discreetly
to a dance. There is something magical about that moment when the eyes
meet the eyes and a complex agreement is established between the man who
asked and the woman who accepted. For those who lived the times when that
was the only way to act, the enactment of the tradition brings nostalgic
memories of conquests and defeats.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Briefly the lonely woman
with the look of an outsider turned her head and caught the eyes of TangoMan
who smiled and nodded. She drew a faint smile and turned her head back
to staring at the dance floor. She never looked back. Did she understood
that an invitation had been made? Was she only exchanging pleasant salutations?
Had she come here to watch? Had she wanted to dance?</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The TangoMan never found
out because while he was on the dance floor, the lonely woman gathered
her belongings, got up, walked out and left. How would she rationalize
the evening? Would she go home and cry and feel the frustration of not
being asked to dance? Would she join the women who forgo their opportunity
to live the full experience of Tango dancing and decide she wants to lead?</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The TangoMan will never know,
and perhaps in some other community another woman will fall through the
cracks of Tango ignorance or join the forces that decry tradition and good
manners. As he continued to scan the room looking for another eye contact,
many women continued with their conversations and distractions. How many
dances would they miss? Why is it that the teaching of the Tango never
covers the simple rituals that are built on a tradition that has brought
together many men and women to the dance floor to engage in a consensual
embrace that leads to exhilaration and enjoyment? Here, he thought, there
was a lesson to be learned.</font></font>
