<h1>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">It Could Happen To You</font></h1>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Up to now most books written
as testimonials of personal Tango experiences tend to fall under the category
of out of body encounters of the me-silly kind. Like, "have you ever 'ocho'
at the DMV?" Or, "I saw Santa Tangoing with my mommy to Jingle Bells."
Or the lunacy of asking the rethorical question, "you know you are a Tango
junkie if..."</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Some day somebody will actually
document the real experiences which most of us have lived from the day
the Tango found us. They may describe the first time they saw a couple
dancing Tango. They may even remember exactly the date, their state of
mind, and the circumstances of their lives at the time. Those with a lot
more mileage will doubtless credit Tango Argentino, the legendary show
of the nineteen eighties, with the compelling desire to be able to Tango,
to experience the passion and sensuality, not to mention the prowess smartly
staged by a group of seemingly average, middle aged couples.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Others may remember hearing
from a friend, or picking up a flyer where Argentine Tango lessons were
being offered. Trusting, and with a naive sense of anticipation, you may
have begun to take at face value all the rethorical coating that accompanied
every lesson, every frustrated attempt to imitate the role model being
presented to you. You may not longer remember the names of the teachers
that began to come in and out in a revolving door like fashion, all the
while your mind feeling like a Texas size omelette.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>There might be cases where
the stories will take on their own spin given personal and geographical
circumstances. There might be accounts of styles wars within a city, mostly
the result of shrewd operators in cahoots with ethically challenged professionals
prying upon the trust and blind allegiance of eager learners. It would
take a lot of soul searching and a mega dose of self respect and self esteem
for ackowledging cases of blunt breach of trust, disappointment and the
realization that no matter how one says it, lies and deception have short
legs.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>However in spite of the emotional
exposure with all risk when allowing the Tango to take over our lives,
there is a moment when we finally get it, or not. They say that Tango is
a very personal thing, that no respectable dancer will face the scorn of
their peers for being imitators, and we have heard of those who have taken
their "secrets" to the grave. On the other hand they say that there are
no secrets in the Tango, only those who refuse to see its simplicity, its
infinite set of possibilities, its endurance through acceptance and rejection,
its universal appeal to the human soul far beyond frontiers and idiosyncrasies.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The story I like to write
is about every door that opened to show another set of doors which in time
opened themselves into larger universes where men and women who lived and
danced longer gave a mole or a mountain of their own experience, their
imperfect, yet special human qualities, their internal energy and their
intimate expression of a rhythm. All within the context of making you aware
of your own possibilities, your own achievements, and your fragile humanity.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I would qualify many cynical
attitudes as those from passionate men and women who might be afraid to
be disappointed again, but I would continue to pass along what has been
given to me, as an unexpected (and may be undeserved) gift . The privilege
of looking into other's Tango life experiences and learn form them. It
could happen to me that I'm called to tell the story of my appreciation
for those who guided my steps. Or It could happen to you.</font></font>
