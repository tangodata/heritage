<h1>
<b>Reflections on love and hate</b></h1>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>It is hard to imagine a time
when Tango did not exist. It has been around all of our life and the lives
of our parents and grand parents but not much more before that. From the
early 1880's it was a dance form and a musical expression practiced mostly
by the marginal element of Buenos Aires. The establishment treated it like
the bastard offspring of an illicit liaison. Its existence was not recognized;
it was hidden behind the sordid shacks of the slums. It did not make the
social pages; society did not issue any valid documentation to assert its
date of birth and family line.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Times have changed dramatically
and today we tend to look at children born out of wedlock in a whole different
way. If Tango was to be born today, it would have much better odds to become
accepted and go on to become a success than it had one hundred years ago.
That is what is so remarkable about it.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Spawned from a mix of rhythms
and melodies brought to the port city of Buenos Aires by African slaves,
it probably picked up some texture in Haiti and Cuba, and continued its
leavening catharsis with the infusion of popular themes from Andalucia
and the rural plight of the nomad inhabitants of the Argentine pampas.
When the European immigrants completed the ingredients of the melting pot
of an incipient popular society, the Tango became a symbol of their identity
and an expression of their pride and joy.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>This fact did not go unnoticed
by enterprising Europeans who found original ways to introduce the erotic
choreography and the catchy music to sophisticated audiences in Paris,
London and New York way before the outbreak of World War I. By the time
Rudolph Valentino made Tango “famous” in The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse,
the people of Buenos Aires had began to carve the foundations of the Argentine
Tango we love and so dearly care about today.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The illegitimate child of
the poor, the slaves, the less-than-respectable members of a simmering
socially challenged class, had grown into a respectable role model for
a new generation of porte&ntilde;os who took pride in the interpretation
of the music, the versification of its songs and the crafting of a fundamental
choreography that is purely based on the expression of emotions and the
ritual of the embrace. Every porte&ntilde;o claims it righfully as their
unique patrimony. No claim is made though about the conglomerate of emotions,
feelings and other traits that conform the human race.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>That is why we can embrace
the Tango as our own anywhere, anytime. It’s a spontaneous love affair
that no logical reasoning can define. Total strangers connecting at the
floor level in a mystical realization that there is something to be shared.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>A kaleidoscopic array of
emotions that includes pure passion, blind faith, admiration, respect,
friendship, jealousy, envy and oddly occasional irrational demonstrations
of hate. They all form part of the dynamics of every single Tango hamlet
around the world, and they all somehow find in the Tango a redeeming reason
to exist within the realm of the embrace because they are all expressions
of the sorrow for our brief life stopover on our way to eternal solitude.</font></font>
