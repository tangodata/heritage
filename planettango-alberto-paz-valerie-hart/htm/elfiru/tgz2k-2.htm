<font face="Times New Roman,Times">What's in a word</font></h1>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>When trying to put a historical
perspective on the development of what is known today as the Argentine
Tango, we often run into a variety of myths, and a series of tales conveniently
packaged for effect and amusement.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>However, when it comes to
attempting to expand the scope of understanding of the circumstances surrounding
the evolution of the city of Buenos Aires, its sociopolitical structure,
and the ever-changing demographics that reflected over the last one hundred
and fifty years the parallel evolution of the maximum popular expression
of the city and its inhabitants, it is dissapointing to hear the overt
denial expressed in the form of “I don’t know if I really want to know
that much.”</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>This is typical of the syndrome
known as the political economy of passion. A society that is puritanical
at its roots embraces the exotic aspects of a dance that has been packaged
for foreign consumption by artists of a Third World country.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Being able to count to eight
while beating a pattern to death, has given a nation that frowns upon public
display of affection, the mechanics of hugging and kissing, the freedom
to fantasize in silence about short lapses of wild passion and Zen-like
trances, and an exciting alternative to PTA meetings or Youth Soccer volunteer
work.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Of course, there are many
who are willing (unafraid?) to look beyond the veil of superficial symbolism
to find the substantive components that have forged the unique ingredients
that form the core of the body of knowledge known as the History of the
Argentine Tango. I expect that those will continue to read, comment and
discuss. For their inquisitive minds, the research time is well spent.
This
knowledge to various degrees of depth is what most Argentinos grow up with
whether they'll ever set foot on a dance floor or not.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Take the origin of the word
Tango for example. Even when there is no final word as to where the word
Tango comes from, we tend not to spin the wheel of trivia if it cuts into
our dancing time. I suspect that it will never be determined and eventually
we will settle for some combination of theories that will satisfy our curiosity
so we can move onto another hot topic: heels first or toes first, for example.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>There is a current agreement
among researchers that conclude that the meaning of the word Tango conveys
the idea of an enclosed place, a place of dance, the dance itself, the
unavoidable participation of blacks with their noisy instruments and their
dances. We must keep in mind that it was the white man who concocted all
the definitions and conclusions that led to some of the very well known
definitions, based on his interpretation of social aspects according with
his culture, religion, and his own cultural prejudices of the world he
was facing in the 1800’s. His lack of knowledge about the people with whom
he had to interact, to understand and comprehend their actions, created
the philosophical dilemma of “I” and “the others.”</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In other words, everything
that didn’t coincide with the white man’s mentally structured, orderly
and regimented world based on his values, belonged to “the others.” The
Tango, a product of “the others,” had almost a forty year history before
the first written testimonial of its existence was published. The year
was 1913, the writer somebody only known to this day by his ‘Nome de plume’
Viejo Tanguero.</font></font>
