<h1>
A Critical Eye on the Critic</h1>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><b>T</b>he difference between
a theater critic and the general public who attend a show is that a critic
gets paid to pose as an expert while the public pays to become an expert.
There are some who base their decisions to see a show on the opinion of
critics who trust that the brain impaired will actually give more than
a pitiful look at da kritic's pathetic self importance.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Every artist likes to see
their performance linked to the words "critically acclaimed," and we all
tend to play the game of discounting the importance of uninformed paid
reviewers while at the same time biting our nails waiting for the overnight
reviews.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>This is about a new show
that opened in <b>San Francisco </b>on November 17 and goes by the unassuming
name of TANGO. This is about the foresight of a visionary who made a choice,
fifteen years after
<b>Tango Argentino</b> swept the world off its feet
and introduced the “sausage making machine” that every single Tango show
after that has used to make the same sausages with a variety of tastes
and flavors. Creator and Director <b>Rafael Nicolau</b>’s choice was a
“parrillada al uso nuestro.”
<b>TANGO</b> is modern traditionalism and
traditional modernism. It is as genuine and tasteful as the juicy "bife
argentino," the Argentine top sirloin, the only contemporaneous import
from <b>Argentina</b> that would seem palatable to the clich&eacute; ridden,
exoticism infatuated mentality of <b>Allan Ulrich</b>, theatre critic for
the <b>San Francisco Examiner</b>.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Heading off with <i>TANGO
hasn’t got much tang,</i> <b>Ulrich</b> discovers right away that <i>the
latest Argentine import can’t match its predecessor,</i> and he decides
that the Tango <i>being the new opiate of the elite it would be easier
than ever to quit cold turkey.</i> Then, matter of factly he announces
that <i>in an era when Tango records have replaced Gregorian chants anthologies
as the crossover musical diversion of choice for the intelligentsia, every
tango producer wants to find a tango show. The model for all them remains
Tango Argentino.</i> Of course, we were waiting for a no brainer punchline.
<i>That
spectacle boasted a stage band that featured the master of tango nuevo,
Astor Piazzolla and the haunting wheeze of his bandoneon,</i><b>Ulrich</b>
finally obliges. All right, correct me if I am wrong but Piazzolla
<b>NEVER</b>
set foot on the stage of <b>Tango Argentino</b>, so that goes to show you
that any bum can become a critic if he can manage to flash the “facts”
on a handwritten cardboard waved at the windshields of unsuspecting theater
going motorists.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><i>The essence of tango occasionally
comes through, </i>continues <b>Allan Ulrich</b>, giving a thumbs up to
a rendition of <b>Don’t Cry For Me Argentina</b> and <b>Malambo</b>, a
sizzling percussive folklore solo, which is to the essence of tango as
a <b>Sammy Davis Jr</b>. tap dancing number would be at <b>The Lawrence
Welk</b> show.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Would it be too harsh to
suggest that <b>Allan Ulrich</b> read the latest news from <b>Argentina</b>
in a plastic sealed copy of <b>Bordello Today</b>? Fortunately, the elite
intelligentsia, as <b>Ulrich </b>puts it, has made a lot of inroads into
<b>Buenos
Aires</b> and the channels of communication are linked by fiber optics,
satellites and the Internet.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><b>Ulrich</b> never suspects
that <i>an older gentleman,</i> played by
<b>Mariano Monzon</b>, <i>in
a mime episode is supposed to be Piazzolla himself,</i> and he never gets
the point of a pair of senior dancers (<b>Mariano Monzon</b> and show choreographer
<b>Ofelia
Caviello</b>)
<i>creakily attempting a routine on one side of the stage,
while, opposite, a young couple</i> ( <b>Nelson</b> and <b>Yanina</b>)
<i>go
through similar motions</i> to the masterful <b>Cholo Montironi</b>’s rendition
of
<b>Recuerdo</b>. Comprende, che <b>Ulrich</b>? A critic is not required
to know about <b>Osvaldo Pugliese</b>’s masterpiece nor is he expected
to do his homework about the cultural and artistic evolution of a foreign
country. As long as there are brain impaired theater goers who heed the
advice of uninformed and lazy critics, their job is safe. The men and women
who put on an original, provocative, daring, unconventional, genuine and
honest piece of Argentine art on stage, called <b>TANGO</b>, can’t say
the same.</font></font>
