<h1>
Earning Our Daily Tangos</h1>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><b>T</b>ime flies when you are
having fun. Far removed from the stereotypes and clich&eacute;s that the
Argentine Tango seems to induce when we first become aware of its existence,
learning to retrain our bodies and finding out more about our inner souls,
brings about a change in the way we conduct ourselves and the way we restructure
our lives. That is, if we are willing to change and assume the new found
responsibility of taking care of ourselves in ways that perhaps we never
thought of.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>For the second year in a
row, the <b><a href="reno98.htm">Labor Day Weekend</a></b> in Reno, Nevada
proved to be the pinnacle of our yearly efforts. That is the time of the
year when we engage ourselves with a special group of friends for a weekend
long of enjoyment of the Tango experience. New ideas flow freely, old and
new concepts are put under scrutiny, a fraternal spirit rolls in like a
shroud of mystical fog in the middle of a serene ocean. It is like being
invited to a major premiere and finding out that you are in it.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Soon after that, we embarked
on another first time experience. Teaching our dance in paradise. The mere
mention of Hawaii in connection with Tango tends to make people smile with
a “how lucky can you get” look, followed by an accomplice wink that presumes
the making of a curro, the lunfardo equivalent of a con job that Buenos
Aires journalists are using to describe the plane loads of “tango experts”
and "movie stars" that are being auctioned around the country as the second
coming of El cachafaz.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Indeed we got very lucky
because soon after our arrival we met a group of dedicated Tango dancers
who weekly give up their God given right to sip Mai Tais on the beach,
to dress in regulation Tango black and put their bodies through the motions
of salidas and cruzadas. Returning from ten days in Honolulu without a
trace of suntan gave a better insight of understanding how committed a
pig really is to the making of the ham that goes along with the eggs for
breakfast.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>It also gave a newer sense
of respect for the people who want to learn to dance Tango. That sense
grew further when we went back to Troy, Michigan and then visited Cleveland,
Ohio for the first time. No matter the color of their skins, the accent
of their voices, the shapes of their bodies or the level of their education,
we met some of the most wonderful individuals and we connected with everyone
of them at the intellectual and emotional levels. In some cases it was
very humbling to be treated as the cable repairman on a deserted island.
It has added more weight to our sense of responsibility to continue bringing
to you an honest and fair proposition.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>We consider it a privilege
sharing our personal experience, our love for the Tango, and the teachings
of the great masters passed along from Petroleo to Mingo to ourselves and
to our friends. Nothing new, just the facts, the empowering thrill of knowledge,
the good old time religion tenet of earning our daily Tango with the sweat
of our feet</font></font>.
