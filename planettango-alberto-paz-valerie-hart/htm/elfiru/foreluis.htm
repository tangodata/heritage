<i><font size=+1>Five years after it first came to San Francisco, Forever
Tango returned to the Theater on the Square with joy and happiness for
the major achievement of Luis Bravo and his spectacular show. Back in August
1994 when the first issue of El Firulete came to life, it would have been
difficult to imagine the success and accomplishments of Forever Tango,
which opened in San Francisco one month later. On March 16, 1999, El Firulete's
co-editor and Argentine Tango dance instructor Valorie Hart sat at a table
at the Sir Francis Drake Hotel's Scala Restaurant with Forever Tango's
creator and director Luis Bravo, choreographer and dancer Miriam Larici
and partner Alberto Paz, for a personal and enjoyable dinner. Luis, Miriam,
Valorie and Alberto candidly talked about the Tango, the show, and the
people who believed in it and those who didn't.</font></i>
<p><i>Sometimes the emotional drama and intense passion of the Argentine
Tango turns into a happy face with a good natured smile. This happened
when Hillary Reinis phoned to announce that Forever Tango was returning
to the Theater on the Square. A little more than a year before, she solemnly
stated that there would never be another Tango show at TOTS.</i>

<td><i>Luis Bravo’s Forever Tango is once again “home” at San Francisco’s
Theater on the Square. Home, because this is where Forever Tango had its
longest run, lasting the now legendary ninety-two weeks. Shortly after
leaving San Francisco, Bravo took his beloved creation on a national tour
becoming the first Argentino to produce a show on the Broadway stage in
New York. The show not only was a hit but it also broke Tango Argentino's
record performance on the Great White Way. Now, after five years of successfully
touring two companies around the USA and internationally in Italy, England,
Mexico, Canada and Japan, he and Theater on The Square owners Hillary and
Jonathan Reinis find themselves with a rare six week&nbsp;</i></td>

<i>Surprisingly, given the cult-like following that the Argentine Tango
tends to spawn, the opening night capacity audience was not made up of
a majority of local tangueros. Many say they will see the show again, but
seem to be lulled into thinking that these six weeks will extend into another
long run. Luis Bravo assures us that this is not the case, since he has
already booked the show in Japan, and is only utilizing one company.</i>

<td><i>The theater was full, and the audience was completely ready to love
the show. It is always nice to have a Broadway success precede a production
(as well as the Boston Pops /Forever Tango collaboration that was widely
televised this past summer on prestigious PBS). The cast and orchestra
did not disappoint. After five years of performing, they were accomplished,
yet energized and fresh and they gave it their all. Many of them consider
San Francisco their home after Argentina, and they seemed genuinely happy
to be on the stage here again.&nbsp;</i>
<p><i>The familiar set was revealed with the starry night backdrop. The
giant bandoneon opened to deliver the athletic silhouette of Cesar Coelho,
and Miriam Laricci looking more gorgeous than ever, in her now signature
silver dress. A palatable wave of excitement and nostalgia caressed the
audience. Then the lights came up on the eleven piece orchestra as it swung
into the gorgeous overture. Lisandro&nbsp;</i></td>

<i>He’s filling in for a week or so, and enjoying every minute of it. When
he plays the cello, he is completely relaxed, without a thought to the
huge responsibilities of being the director and creator of a hit show.
If you read the program notes, you know that Luis is firstly a very accomplished
musician, reaping years of accolades for his mastery of the cello. After
studying in Argentina, and successfully playing in the most prestigious
orchestras, he came to the United States at age twenty-three to study with
a very famous teacher by the name of Ron Leonard. At the time, Leonard
was not accepting students. This didn’t deter Bravo, as he came to Los
Angeles with a few letters of recommendation and the chutzpah to find out
where Leonard lived, and then went there and knocked on his door. Luis
spoke no English then, but managed to convey his desire to study with the
celebrated teacher. He showed him his letters of recommendation which meant
nothing to Leonard. However, he asked Luis to play for him. The result
was that Leonard recognized a rare talent and accepted Luis, who then studied
with Leonard for two years. When his money ran out for lessons, Bravo raised
the money by doing construction work. One can only imagine a master cello
player’s hands doing hard and dangerous labor. To this day Luis considers
this experience one of the best in his life. It gives him a total appreciation
and involvement with any dedicated and hard working person.&nbsp;</i>
<p><i>By this time Bravo was trying to get work as a master cellist, but
it was tough going. Also around this time he joined Lisandro Adrover as
a guest musician in Tango Argentino. It was then that he began to mastermind
the idea to create his show Forever Tango. Luis is very outspoken about
the artistic possibilities that the Argentine Tango is capable of representing
beyond the simplistic vision of the dance for export that initially appeals
to the foreign audiences. He has pushed the envelope of artistic freedom
with costumes, hair and makeup design, lighting, colors, choreographed
vignettes and rich musical arrangements, that don't attempt to tell the
history of the Argentine Tango, but deliver a very polished stage presentation
where the Tango is the main protagonist. The fact that he had the vision,
the willingness to follow his dream and the money to pay for his production
makes him a maverick among the critics and colleagues in his native Argentina.&nbsp;</i>
<p><i>Bravo is a visionary, an artist, a risk taker, a hard worker, a strong
personality. He has the guts to realize his convictions. He has had (and
still has) many detractors. He is aware of those who laughed at him when
he first put his ideas forth. They laughed at the idea and expense of an
eleven piece orchestra. The laughed at the concept of the giant bandoneon.
They laughed at his idea of including older milongueros to partner sizzling
Marcela Duran in the sexually suggestive number A Evaristo Carriego. They
laughed at the idea of his overseeing the look of the show from Miriam’s
famous silver dress and beaded headpiece, to the elegant lighting design,
not to mention his intense input into the formation of the orchestrations,
dance numbers and staging. They scoffed at the idea of including a traditional
singer in the form of Carlos Morel for a largely non Spanish speaking audience.
They never thought there would be enough work to employ two and sometimes
three companies of musicians, dancers and stage crew for so many years.
The company payroll has amounted to millions and millions of dollars. At
this time Forever Tango has warehouses full of costumes and props and equipment
all over the country. Luis reckons that there must be at least five hundred
pairs of dance shoes among these things. He didn't dismiss the suggestion
of a Forever Tango garage sale.&nbsp;</i>
<p><i>By the time Luis reveals his weakness for creme brule, we have learned
from him and Miriam that Luis nurtures each dancer in the way of perhaps
a version of the old Hollywood star system. For many of the performers,
this is their first time away from home. Bravo has given more opportunities
and a chance to see the world to many new dancers than anyone else in Argentina.
He takes them to his home in the San Gabriel mountains in Southern California
and feeds them and lets them rest. He has built a stage in his back yard.
He rehearses his precious talent there, often at night under moonlight,
so that they will become accustomed to the lighting he has created for
the stage. He suggests and provides a myriad of ways to make each performer
be at their best, from perhaps a new hairstyle, to working out at the gym
to get into condition for the grueling task of eight shows a week.&nbsp;</i>
<p><i>So what’s next for the show? It’s as tight and perfect as it can
be. Luis says that after five years, he’s pretty much taken it as far as
it can go. He plans to do a Forever Tango book, narrowing down some of
the five thousand or so photos depicting backstage and on stage images.
He plans a DVD of the show through Polygram for release in the United States
(the DVD and CD have already been released in Japan).&nbsp;</i>
<p><i>There is the Asian tour commencing with Japan and then moving onto
the Philippines, Korea and China. Of course the inevitable question comes
up as to whether he will ever bring the show to Buenos Aires. He is wistful
when asked this question. Bravo has truly never received the support or
admiration of his countrymen. In fact they have been among the loudest
of his detractors. It is both historically classic and ironic that so many
artists need to go outside of their home turf to find success and acceptance.
Luis has probably employed more Argentine dancers and musicians and crew
then any production including Tango Argentino. He has reaped awards, critical
acclaim and artistic and financial success. His creation of Forever Tango
is largely responsible for refueling the current revival of Argentine Tango,
the music and the dance worldwide.&nbsp;</i>
<p><i>Luis confesses that after five years of realizing his dream, he is
tired. He sleeps only three or four hours a night. Forever Tango has spun
off many other business interests and added responsibilities. However,
he is first and foremost an artist, and the mere act of creating is the
energy that makes him live. A regular home life and family are things he
would like too. So as he winds down Forever Tango into the next millennium,
he is also working on a new musical for Broadway, a movie and perhaps more
time to play the cello at home surrounded by loved ones. Never underestimate
the foresight of a visionary.</i>
