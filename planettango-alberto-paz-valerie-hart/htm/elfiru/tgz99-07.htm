<font face="Times New Roman,Times">The loss of innocence</font></h1>
<i><u><font size=+1>A fictional vignette in the tango key of life</font></u></i>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>El Taita had been lying in
a ditch by the side of the road of life for more than he cared to remember.
Surrounded by weeds and the alluring webs of black widow spiders, he seemed
to be rehearsing the final of act of lying to eternal rest. At age twenty
seven he had already planted a garden, but the thorns had bled his heart.
He had written a book, but the pages were blank.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The sun had sunk for its
daily swim into the Pacific ocean on that hot July evening. The bougainvillea
fluttered with the westerly breeze. From the humanoid shaped boughs a white
winged butterfly took to the air and for three minutes danced with the
lift that the hot air created under its wings. Then after a graceful glide
it landed on his chest.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>His eyes opened and the vision
of dark clouds in the sky stiffened his spine with the icy feeling of an
ominous presage. His eyes focused on the dancing butterfly resting on his
chest. "Pugliese is dead," she said, "we have to dance forever and make
his death the meaning of our lives.”&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The notes of Recuerdo ripped
through the silence of the night and riding on the wings of the white winged
dancing butterfly El Taita saw the world from high above for the first
time.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>"Promise me that you’ll play
Recuerdo the day of my funeral," she whispered. "Yes," he couldn't hold
a sob, "and La mariposa too." How tangoish to plan for the unavoidable
at the pinnacle of happiness and joy. Pugliese had transformed Celedonio
Flores's bitterly poignant lyrics into the philharmonic masterpiece that
Pedro Maffia meant to write. "I don’t regret to have loved you so much."&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The flight of fancy and innocence
continued and one day she brought a man she said was going to be good.
She said, "we must open our hearts and our lives to welcome the tango men
and women from Argentina and help them succeed and open doors for their
craft and skills to be shown."&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>For an instant, the blank
pages of Taita’s book filled with words of wisdom and caution, but there
was something compelling and remarkable about the notion of giving without
asking, and so they gave.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The man was good and he succeeded.
The communities where he traveled loved him and admired him, and he was
generous in recognizing the friendship and respect he had been given.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>But this is a tango story,
and as tango stories go, there was also a dark side. For a while, the back
door visits to the bedroom were handled with the discretion that personal
matters should be handled. After all, it also takes two or at least two
per indiscretion to do the horizontal tango.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Taita realized that the denial
of the addiction bred a nauseating sense of impotence. The need for an
ever constant feeding of the addiction blurred the boundaries between personal
and public image, bringing to life Discepolo’s allegoric view of life from
the windows of a cambalache, a surreal pawn shop where bibles lay next
to water heaters, and wives, daughters, friends and lovers pile up on the
shelves of moral decay.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Taita gave the man the best
possible advice a friend and business partner could have given. The reaction
was hostile and it reached a point of no return when angry and vindictive,
the man reached to crush the wings of the dancing butterfly.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The landing was perilous
but safe. Standing up on his feet for the first time Taita pointed to the
door and the man, with tears in his eyes, slowly walked away. Suddenly,
El Taita realized that he was standing tall on the road of life, far from
the spider infected ditch. Pugliese’s right hand fell on the center of
the keyboard, his left hand tapped the keys next to his right hand on one
beat, and dug deeply on the farthest keys to the left on the next beat.
Yum-bah, yum-bah, yum-bah, yum-bah!&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>El Taita embraced the butterfly
and bringing his head next to her face, he marked a side step and they
began to dance.&nbsp;</font></font>

Pugliese, who died on July 25, 1995</font></font></u></i>
