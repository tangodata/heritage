      <div class="copy">In the nineties I found out about the death of,
first my dad and five years later my mom, too late to be at their side,
given the choice I made earlier in my life to move away and live in
another land, far away from home.<br>
      <br>
In many ways, they still live in my memories as they have for the past
thirty two years, and I know that sometime in the future I will join
them for the eternal journey. The point is that somewhere in my heart
and soul, the tears and grief associated with the death of our beloved
ones, are
still prisoners of distance and separation. This seems to have been the
blessing or the curse of immigrants and emigrants who went to or
departed from Argentina during the last century and a half. I no longer
wonder about the tears bursting from my eyes and the sobs that threaten
to explode inside my chest as La rayuela by Pugliese reaches the
sublime moment when violins and bandoneons sing and cry in an
anticipated celebration of the inevitable ending of the song.<br>
      <br>
I first saw Rodolfo and Maria early in June 1996 at a milonga in
Berkeley, California. The introduction by the host barely cut across
the indifference of a vocal crowd who seemed to have gotten used to the
necessary evil of interrupting the milongas with "announcements." All
we could see was an
elderly couple tastefully dancing to the Pugliese's rendition of
Emancipacion.<br>
      <br>
Nineteen-ninety-six was a transition year for our Tango dancing
education, so even when the couple on the dance floor was not "hot
dogging," flying or otherwise trying to impress the ignorant, I was
left in a daze by the craftsmanship and seductive allure of their ever
precise and calculated moves. But what really affected me the most, was
Rodolfo's cherub-like smile as
he played with the creative genius of Pugliese coming from the
speakers. A
few days later, for reasons that no longer matter, a common friend
brought them to our house, where they lived for the remaining weeks of
their sole stay in the United States.<br>

      <div class="subtitle">A Club named Suerte Loca</div>
Rodolfo danced the same way all his life never considering the
possibility that something special would ever happen to change the
course of his life.<br>
      <br>
In 1954 the orchestra of Anibal Troilo headed the cast of El Patio de
la Morocha at a theater on Avenida Corrientes. They needed dancing
couples Maria recalls, "This was before we got married, they came to
talk to us but Rodolfo didn't want to do it."<br>
      <br>
It's not that he didn't have the opportunity, but he never wanted to
dance professionally. That's just fine with Maria, because If he had
started doing it then, we wouldn't be here together today.<br>
      <br>
More than twenty years went by without dancing and being married with
children. When the daughter finally got married herself, Rodolfo was
working out of a Ford pick up truck doing what the UPS men and women do
today, pick
up and delivery of packages. Faced with an empty nest, he didn't want
to
consider getting older quicker by coming home to watch television. He
had
heard about a popular tangueria that was in vogue, Volver, on
Corrientes and Suipacha. One Friday, celebrating a windfall of money
that had come his way at work, he invited Maria to go dancing at
Volver. Arriving early, they told the maitre d' that they were new to
the scene, and asked for a good spot on the dance floor from where he
proceeded to watch the caliber of the dancers as they kept arriving.<br>
      <br>
At 2 AM they played La cumparsita and ten to fifteen couples took to
the floor. "The music of Troilo from the Forties gives you room to do a
lot of things," Rodolfo said, "so when they began playing it I told
Maria,
let's lead the way and I went "pin, pan, pow." Half an hour later a
young
couple approached our table. She was an Argentine woman living in
France.
He was her French partner."<br>
      <br>
They had seen them dance and asked if they were teachers. No, they were
told. They were just milongueros from Buenos Aires and that's all.
Rodolfo said that he always danced because he felt the Tango deep
inside. Later Rodolfo and Maria joined the young couple at their table
and found out that they were staying at a hotel. They invited them to
move to their home were they developed a good friendship while teaching
them to dance Tango the way
they knew.<br>
      <br>
When the couple finally left for Europe they asked Rodolfo if they
would consider traveling to France. Of course answered Rodolfo, but as
the plane took off he turned to Maria and said, "I doubt that these
people would want to pay me to go to Europe after they've seem over a
hundred couples dancing at Volver."<br>
      <br>
Six months later they received a letter and two plane tickets. The trip
to France was happening. As they pondered the reality of crossing the
ocean on a puny airplane, Rodolfo and Maria couldn't believe their
insane luck on that fateful day of 1988.<br>
      <br>
The woman in question had a dance academy in Marseilles, and she had
put together a major production based on the History of Tango. The
expensive project played once at Teatro del Molino, and it included a
full comparsa of black people entering the stage from behind the public
to perform a
candombe number that left Maria gasping.<br>
      <br>
      <u>Maria</u>: "It was a wonderful experience and we're forever
grateful to that woman for giving us that first opportunity. Sadly,
within
twenty days things turned sour as misunderstandings turned into
problems.
The hostess, who later gave up tango dancing, erred badly with us.
Gradually she began demanding to be Rodolfo's partner. She wanted him
to dye his hair
and to get rid of his glasses."<br>
      <br>
      <u>Rodolfo</u>: I said to her: you saw me dancing in Buenos
Aires; you saw me dancing with my wife. That's how you agreed to bring
us here, as a couple. Now, you can't ask us to do something different.
No way."<br>
      <br>
Thirty days to the date they arrived in France, Rodolfo and Maria left
the woman's house and moved in with Elena, who with partner Alfredo
tried very hard to help them survive for the remaining six months of
their stay. Singing, dancing Tango and folklore, Rodolfo and Maria
managed to make
ends meet stranded in a foreign land, handicapped by the language
barrier,
with plenty of tools of their own and help from generous compatriots.
Rene
Fabianelli was one of them. In the years that followed, Rene became the
"guardian angel" who organized their successful tours around France and
the rest of Europe. Meanwhile in Buenos Aires Rodolfo kept telling
friends
about their crazy luck, and that one day he'll open his own Tango Club,
appropriately named, Suerte Loca.<br>
      <br>
      <div class="subtitle">A Milonguero of good stock</div>
Rodolfo learned to dance Tango from his father as a kid. His mother
objected because she wanted him to go to school and be somebody.
Rodolfo did both. He pleased his proud father at the old man's milongas
in La Paternal
dancing with sisters and cousins at the tender age of ten. Time came
for
Rodolfo to go to school. Dad insisted that he devote time to study
rather
than dancing. The night life could be dangerous and lead to no good.<br>
      <br>
      <u>Rodolfo</u>: "After the first year of high school I quit. I
told 'mi viejo,' I want to be a dancer. He didn't insist a lot. That's
something I regret today, that he didn't try harder to keep me in
school."<br>
      <br>
He developed a style and spent years as a night creature of the
milongas. When he met Maria, she was barely fourteen. Dating in those
days meant
meeting her at the street corner by her house while the sun was up. A
vampire
would have fared better, but he kept his courtship up for almost three
years.<br>
      <br>
      <u>Maria</u>: "I was seventeen years old when I married the first
and only man I had known. I wanted to sing, to play the guitar.
Suddenly, the 'no' of my father had been replaced by the 'no' of my
husband. Meanwhile, he kept going out addicted to the life of the
milonga and the allure of
other women. It's a long story, but I wasn't prepared for that. His
parents
played an important role making me come back every time I had decided
to
leave."<br>
      <br>
      <u>Rodolfo</u>: "We were separated three times until my Dad
kicked me out of the house and told me I was worse than garbage for
playing with the life of a decent and loving woman. He told me in no
uncertain terms
that I had to choose between the milonga and my family. Well, thanks to
all that we are together today, enjoying something that I never
expected:
dancing and making friends."<br>
      <br>
They have danced together and they have witnessed a time when there
were real dancers at every club. Dancers who competed to be the best.
Dancers who would never consider imitating anybody else. Dancers who
dressed to
kill to impress the ladies before dazzling them with their brilliance
on
the dance floor. They both admire Juan Bruno, the Juan Bruno from the
time
when he used to dance Tango Salon.<br>
      <br>
      <u>Maria</u>: "Very few could dance Tango Salon. It is very
difficult for the couple to walk with the feet on the floor. To execute
paradas and turns with a smooth rhythm and with the feet on the floor.
Juan seemed
to walk like no one I've ever seen. Rodolfo doesn't have the profile to
dance Salon. It doesn't look good on him."<br>
      <br>
      <u>Rodolfo</u>: "Before he quit Juan was a bailarin de tranco
largo, a bird with long legs gliding over the surface of a lake. His
moves were
deliberately slow. What I showed you today in the canyengue, how to
break
your waist for example, in Tango Salon you have to do it very subtly,
like
a filigrana, like a watermark on paper, a delicate move which is both
elegant
and fancy. You have to stand up firmly and well grounded, and you need
a
partner who does not hang on you to drop you off your balance. When
Juan
stepped on the floor for a Di Sarli piece, chills ran down my spine
before
he even began to move. I have never seen any of today's teachers
attempting
to dance that way. It's very hard. Even Juan, when he came out of
retirement
a couple of years ago, was doing something totally different."<br>
      <br>
      <div class="subtitle">Life is but a dream</div>
Our table talk lingered past dessert time. As a matter of fact time
seemed to hold still. Rodolfo seemed disturbed by the memory of his
father. The elder
Cieri had died in 1966 but his presence still weighs strongly on this
fragile
man with the glassy eyes, leaning against the chair, holding a glass of
wine.
It seems that his father kept appearing in his dreams. The recurring
themes
were answers to whatever was troubling Rodolfo at the time. Like a way
to
finish the barbecue pit he had built on the roof of the house he had
constructed
by hand, one brick at a time. Or the advice on where and how to install
a
bathroom on the upper floor. When Rodolfo talks about his father, the
tone
of his voice lowers, as if he is still aware of his presence. He had
repeated
time after time stories about the early days of his childhood when the
old
man taught him to dance the tango in a way he had forgotten. How he
began
to hate as a child, having to show off in front of Dad's friends at the
neighborhood
clubs. Later, when a young Rodolfo lived from garufa to garufa, a
dapper
ladies' man at the milongas, he avoided facing a disappointed father
with
a pointing finger. For years after the passing of the elder Cieri,
Rodolfo
visited the mausoleum at the Chacarita cemetery. He tried many times to
see
his father with an inexplicable obsession until the time came for
moving
the casket from the mausoleum. The family had to decide between ground
burial
or cremation. Rodolfo convinced the family to have the body cremated
and
the ashes placed next to the graves of his grandparents. As a truck
loaded with caskets arrived, Rodolfo demanded to identify the body. He
was going to see his Dad one last time.<br>
      <br>
      <u>Rodolfo</u>: "They had to use an axe to break the locks and
when they finally opened the casket I yelled at the top of my lungs! My
Dad's body
was intact like the day they put him in the casket. His face, his hands
crossed
over his chest still holding a fresh orchid... My sister hugged me..."
(his
voice breaks and the steady sob of a child fills the room as the tape
recorder
runs for a couple of minutes). He never went to visit the ashes at his
Dad's
final resting place. Yet, the old man kept visiting him in his dreams.
That's
life, he appeared to say." <br>
      <br>
      <div class="subtitle">The tango my Dad once taught me</div>
One day Rodolfo woke up and said to Maria, "I had a dream with my Dad.
It was such a beautiful dream. He came to see me and he congratulated
me because I had built my own house. I told him, you see viejo? I
finally succeeded with the Tango. I have danced in Europe and here in
Buenos Aires on the stage of Teatro San Martin. I told him all about my
friendship with Carlos Garcia, ex-pianist of Roberto Firpo who was now
the director of the Orquesta del Tango de Buenos Aires. He listened
attentively and suddenly said, yes, but you never danced the Tango I
once taught you."<br>
      <br>
Maria had always been curious and excited about the canyengue, so she
asked
Rodolfo why he didn't dance it. Rodolfo said no. He considered it too
difficult,
besides he had completely forgotten what it was that his Dad had taught
him. Then, they got a letter from London inviting them to participate
in
a show. Excited by the opportunity he tried to remember the barrage of
canyengue steps his Dad used to dance, but he could barely remember but
a few. Once again Dad visited him in a dream and helped him remember
many
of the moments they had spent together. Rodolfo remembers telling his
father,
"Your son is going to dance the canyengue Dad."<br>
      <br>
      <u>Rodolfo</u>: "That year in London we presented the canyengue
for
the first time at Paul and Michiko's Cafetin Porte&ntilde;o. People
went
crazy. This Saturday night we are going to dance it for you and Valorie
at your milonga. Maria is going to wear the same vintage dress she wore
in London. Pity that I did not bring my vest and my lengue."<br>
      <br>
      <u>Alberto</u>: You can use mine."<br>
      <br>
      <u>Rodolfo</u>: "Great! We're going to do the canyengue. We're
going
to do it."<br>
      <br>
He was now the only one left in his family and he seemed to wait for
his
time with resignation, whenever it would arrive. Did he know already
about
the illness that would take him away four years later? I'll never
know.Like
the passing of my parents, Rodolfo's departure feels like he just moved
farther away. We're reliving the fond memories now as we have finally
sat
down to watch the videotapes of those great classes in our living room,
along with their compelling performances at the Dance Spectrum in
Campbell.
Maria singing La ultima curda. The two of them dancing canyengue to El
chamuyo. The delight of the audience as they tackled a D'Arienzo piece
with
their unique brand of Tango. <br>
