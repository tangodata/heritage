      <div class="copy">Francisco Canaro and Roberto Firpo, who were
the major exponents of the traditional style 2x4 hot Tango of the Old
Guard attempted to counteract the popularity of the new generation of
trained musicians by opening up their orchestras to young talent like
Cayetano Puglisi, Ciriaco Ortiz and Osvaldo Pugliese.<br>
      <br>
However, around 1924, an entrepreneur with long range vision, began to
hire six piece Tango ensembles, the typical orchestras modeled after
Julio De Caro's Sexteto Tipico, to provide musical background for
silent movies. For the next six years, the movie houses became the
cathedrals where the Tango ruled. Lacking other sources of affordable
entertainment, the working class families of Buenos Aires made these
movie houses their favorite places to spend their free time. Thus, a
large number of the population became exposed to the tango music of
Pedro Maffia, Julio De Caro, Francisco Lomuto, Cayetano Puglisi,
Osvaldo Pugliese, Elviro Vardaro and many others.<br>
      <br>
It was in one of those movie houses, that a chubby fifteen year old kid
heard for the first time the mastery of the bandoneon of Pedro Maffia,
not imagining then that many years later, he himself, Anibal Troilo,
would be called the premier bandoneon of Buenos Aires. Troilo would
later say, "before Pedro Maffia, there was nobody."<br>
      <br>
With a solid reputation as a pianist and a composer, Osvaldo Pugliese
was only eighteen when he wrote Recuerdo, the tango that many experts
consider the birth certificate of the instrumental tango of greater
importance in style and renovation that has ever been written. Because
he was not yet of a legal age, the tango was originally registered
under his father&#8217;s name, Adolfo Pugliese, who had been a flute player
at the turn of the century. When Osvaldo reached the age of twenty-one,
Recuerdo was published once more with his signature.<br>

The tango was bold and advanced for its time. With a rare melody,
extremely beautiful in its harmony and counterpoints, <br>

      <div class="copy">Recuerdo has a
variation for bandoneon that it is very difficult to play as it is
written. It requires gifted digitation, sound technique and a sense of
virtuosity capable of extracting the best out of the possibilities of
the music.<br>
      <br>
The sounds of Recuerdo were first heard in a cafe in the neighborhood
of Villa Crespo, played by a modest quartet that was not equipped with
the acceptable suitability of execution to extol its musical values.
Its premiere went totally unnoticed and it was even retired from the
repertoire for lack of interest by the public that frequented the
establishment.<br>
      <br>
By the winter of 1925, the quartet of the bandoneonist Enrique Pollet
with Emilio Marchiano and Bernardo Perrone on violins, and Osvaldo
Pugliese on the piano, occupied the orchestra pit of cafe A.B.C. With
that quartet's version, Recuerdo would finally reach its true artistic
relevance as the archetype of the instrumental Tango.<br>
      <br>
By 1926, the quartet of Pollet changed venues and format, becoming a
typical sextet of two bandoneons, two violins, Pugliese on piano and a
counterbass. Recuerdo was high in the repertoire of the new orchestra
and it was wildly acclaimed by both the public and the tango musicians
who night after night dropped by to listen to the excellent
interpretations of the Pollet sextet. The public repeatedly demanded
the execution of Recuerdo, almost in every set played by the orchestra.<br>
      <br>
One night Pedro Laurenz was among the selected audience and he
requested a handwritten copy of Recuerdo to bring to Julio De Caro, who
received it with great enthusiasm. It is widely accepted that De Caro&#8217;s
recording on November 9, 1926, is the definitive version of
Recuerdo, never surpassed, only equaled by Osvaldo Pugliese himself,
who in 1944 incorporated Recuerdo into the repertoire of his legendary
orchestra with exactly the same instrumentation that De Caro had used
eighteen years earlier. Not a single note was changed, and Pugliese
even kept the temperamental tempo that De Caro had immortalized in
1926.<br>
      <br>
Sixty years later, on the stage of
the Teatro Colon, towards the end of his glorious career, Osvaldo
Pugliese used a new arrangement of Recuerdo when his fabulous orchestra
was joined by many musicians that had played for him over a span of
forty years. The arrangement and the interpretation recorded in 1986
are a musical tribute to the genius and inspiration of the late Maestro
who pushed the envelope of modernization of the Argentine Tango without
ever severing its roots.<br>
