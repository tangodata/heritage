Style Warmup</H4></CENTER>
As always you should begin your work session with a warmup where you practice
tango style.
<CENTER>
<H4>
Side Steps</H4></CENTER>
<A NAME="SideSteps"></A>In Lesson One you learned the Cadence,&nbsp; Stroll,
Chase, and Rock <A HREF="basics_1.html#BuildingBlocks">basic step patterns</A>.
The last three move forward along the line of dance (the Rock reversing
course in the middle). There are similar patterns that move to the side,
toward the center of the dance floor when you and your partner are oriented
along the LOD. These are the Side Chase, the Side Rock, and not one but
several patterns similar to the Stroll. The Stroll variants you'll learn
about in the <A HREF="basics_6.html#StrollVariants">next lesson</A>; the
other two should be obvious since you already know their forward versions.

Practice</H4></CENTER>
These two new patterns may be seem simple but you must practice them with
other steps to make their use automatic and easy. First do the Side Rock,
pivoting to the left (or right) till you turn 360 degrees. This is the
"Slow Dancing" pattern that almost everyone learns. Like its near-twin
<I>Las Cunitas</I> it can be used when it's impossible to move along the
line of dance. And like its twin it can be used to express tenderness.

<P>Here is another sequence you should try.
<UL>
<LI>
Backward Single Step, Side Chase, Tango Close</LI>
</UL>
Notice that in effect you've just modified the <I>Salida</I> by substituting
the Side Chase for the L-Shaped Walk. This modified <I>Salida</I> is identical
to the second half of the Box Step used in dances such as the foxtrot and
waltz. Since the Tango Close is identical to the first half, what you've
done is almost but not quite a ballroom Box Step. The difference is that
in the Argentine tango Box Step the <I>Salida</I>&nbsp; part of the Box
is done <U>first</U>. And, unlike other ballroom dances, you may often
go to the Right Foot Outside position at the end of the modified <I>Salida</I>.
Also, any number and kind of Two-Step Walks can be (and usually are) inserted
between the two halves of this Box Step.

<P>Here are three more practice sequences. We will use all four again later
in this lesson.
<UL>
<LI>
<A NAME="OpenedBox"></A><U>Forward</U> Single Step (man right forward,
woman left back), Side Chase, Tango Close (the tango Box Step opened up
into a forward-moving pattern like the Zigzag)</LI>

<LI>
Modified <I>Salida</I>, Stroll, Tango Close (the tango Box Step with a
Stroll in the middle)</LI>

<LI>
Stroll, Stroll, Side Rock</LI>
</UL>

<CENTER>
<H4>
<I>Adornos: Intrusiones</I></H4></CENTER>
<I>Intrusiones</I> (Intrusions) are <I>Adornos</I> where you put your foot
or leg between your partner's legs. Sometimes this is just a brief kick.
Sometimes you'll use your foot or leg to push against one of your partner's
feet or legs. When beginning tango the man does the intrusions but as dancers
become more advanced women may do them too. Here is an easy example that
you can use.

<P><A NAME="Entrada"></A>If you're a man, step to your left to begin a
Side Rock. Quickly move your right foot near your left and move it forward
between your partner's legs to touch the inside of her left foot or ankle
with the inside of your right foot or ankle. If she follows good tango
style she will bring her other foot near her supporting foot and you will
feel her sandwich your intruding right foot with her feet. You can then
finish the Side Rock by stepping side right back to your beginning location.

<P>If you're a woman, step to your right to begin a Side Rock. You'll feel
your partner place a foot between your legs, touching the inside of your
right foot or ankle. Follow good tango style by bringing your left foot
near your supporting foot and sandwich his intruding foot. After a brief
pause he and you will finish the Side Rock.

<P>This action is called an <I>Entrada</I> (Entrance). It could have been
done as a brief kick between the woman's legs, but that is more dangerous
and you should wait till you become much more expert before trying kicking
<I>Entradas</I>.

<P>Or you could change the <I>Entrada</I> to a <I>Sacada -- </I>a push
against a free foot, calf, or thigh. If you're a man, do the Side Rock
as just described. However, before you do the second step push with your
right foot against the inside of her free foot before removing your foot
to finish the step. If you're a woman, after sandwiching your partner's
foot or ankle, you may feel him push against the inside of your left foot
with his foot. Just finish the Side Rock as you normally would. (Do <I>Sacadas
</I>only foot-to-foot, calf-to-calf, or thigh-to-thigh. Never use your
ankle or knee; they can easily hurt your partner.)
<CENTER>
<H4>
Practice</H4></CENTER>
You should now practice this example of an <I>Entrada</I> and <I>Sacada</I>.
Do so very slowly at first. Look down to understand what's happening <U>only
the first time or two</U> that you try this. It's very important that you
not develop the bad habit of letting your shoulders slump and your head
droop forward; it'll be very hard to unlearn.

<P>Another important point: tango is not just an athletic activity. You
can use Intrusions to express emotions and to play. The man may, for instance,
be tender or sexy or mischievous or even angry in the way he intrudes.
The woman can reply with her body language in many ways: imperturbable,
playful, annoyed, tender, shy, brazen, and so on. When you practice, and
when you dance, experiment with such possibilities. Just don't get confused
and mistake a play emotion for a real one -- or a real one for a play emotion!
<CENTER>
<H4>
<I>Adornos: </I>Caresses</H4></CENTER>
<I>Caricias</I> (Caresses) are yet another kind of <I>Adorno</I>: rubs
with your leg or shoe against some part of your partner's body. They can
be subtle or extravagant. (The fancier ones you'll usually only see in
a show.) Here are a few examples of each kind, and you can probably think
of more. Just be cautious how you do the showier ones; a Caress that becomes
a fall will not have the effect you desire. Neither will a Caress that
is intimate enough to get you shunned or slapped!

<P>When you do the <I>Entrada</I> <A HREF="#Entrada">described above</A>
either (or both) man and woman can do a Caress. If you're a man, press
your right shoe against her right shoe, gently but still strong enough
to make it clear you intended a caress. Or push your right leg further
between her legs and hook it behind her left leg at the knee, then slide
the back of your calf down the back of her calf.

<P>If you're a woman, when you sandwich the man's foot you can press it
between your feet strongly enough to make it clear you intended a caress.
Or (if he gives you time) instead of doing the sandwich lift your free
(left) leg and hook the back of your knee behind the back of his right
knee, then slide the back of your calf down the back of his calf. Or if
you want to do something even showier, lift your free leg above your waist,
wrap it behind his upper leg, and slowly let it slide down his leg, caressing
the back of his leg with the inside and back of your lower leg.

<P>If you're a man, read the previous paragraph. If you'd like to give
the woman a better chance to do the showy Caresses, stop in the middle
of a side step, straighten your body and lift your right shoulder a few
inches. Leave your right leg extended. This gives your partner a cue that
she's free to do a leg caress and gives her a more obvious target.

<P>A woman can do a <I>Lustrada</I> (Shoe Shine) Caress in several situations.
One is when she's doing an <I>Ocho</I> beside a man with a foot extended,
as in <A HREF="basics_4.html#BackRock">the example</A> at the end of Lesson
Four. She may touch or rub his lower leg with her instep or her shoe top
before lifting her foot over his foot and stepping forward to do an <I>Ocho</I>.
<CENTER>
<H4>
Side Steps and <I>Ochos</I></H4></CENTER>
Side steps give you another way to do <I>Ochos</I>. Here's an example with
intermediate-level difficulty.

<P>Till now both men and women did steps in an almost mirror-like way:
when one stepped forward the other stepped back, when one stepped side
left the other stepped side right in the same direction. Your matching
legs were always parallel with each other, so this is called <I>parallel
walking</I>. Now, however, in the middle of this example the man will take
more steps than the woman and in a different rhythm; from the side it would
look as if your matching legs cross each other, so this is called <I>crossed
walking</I>.

<P>If you're a woman, do four steps in a SLOW SLOW rhythm. Step side right
and turn a bit to your right, then cross your left foot in front of your
right and turn left to face your partner. (This Two-Step Walk -- called
a Side Cross Front -- is covered in depth <A HREF="basics_6.html#StrollVariants">in
the next lesson</A>.) Do a Forward <I>Ocho</I>: 90-plus degree left pivot
on your left foot, step forward right and pivot 180-plus degrees right,
step forward left and pivot 90-plus degrees left.

<P>If you're a man, do a Side Chase in a QUICK QUICK rhythm, a Side Rock
in SLOW SLOW rhythm, then another Side Chase in a QUICK QUICK rhythm. The
first two quick steps add a step so the two of you are doing crossed walking,
the second two quick steps adds another step and brings you back to parallel
walking.
<CENTER>
<H4>
Lead/Follow and Practice</H4></CENTER>
The lead and follow for this pattern is similar to that for any <I>Ocho</I>.

<P>If you're a man, read and do the woman's part in the previous section
to understand her part. Here's how to lead it. Turn your upper body right
a bit as you begin your first Side Chase step. (Don't turn your lower body
during any part of this pattern. Keep it square to the line of dance.)
This turns your partner so that she begins to do a Side Cross Front (a
Two-Step Walk covered in depth <A HREF="basics_6.html#StrollVariants">in
the next lesson</A>).

<P>Finish your Side Chase. Do your Side Rock; as you finish the first step
of it, turn your upper body left a bit. This leads the first part of the
woman's <I>Ocho. </I>After your Side Rock step turn right a bit to lead
the 180-degree turn of her <I>Ocho</I>. To finish, do your second Side
Chase step and turn your body to face straight along the LOD.

<P>If you're a woman, you will feel your partner turn his and your upper
body right a bit as you begin your first side-right step, leading you to
do your second step across in front of your right (the Side Cross Front
). He'll then turn you left a bit to begin your Forward <I>Ocho</I>. After
your <I>Ocho</I> you'll feel him turn his upper body directly forward.
This signals the end of your <I>Ocho</I>.

<P>Do this pattern several times. Do one, two, and three <I>Ochos</I> in
the middle.
<CENTER>
<H4>
Side Steps and Backward <I>Ochos</I></H4></CENTER>
The woman can also do Backward <I>Ochos</I>, by beginning the pattern with
a <U>leftward</U> upper-body pivot so that the woman begins the pattern
with a Side Cross <U>Behind</U> (step side right, cross your left foot
behind your right). She can then smoothly transition into Backward <I>Ochos</I>.
<CENTER>
<H4>
<A NAME="QuickSteps"></A>Music and Quick Steps</H4></CENTER>
In Argentine tango you can move with any tempo on any step. Besides slow
steps you can do very slow or even very very slow steps; you can even stop
totally for a short period of time. <A HREF="basics_2.html#SlowsPauses">A
previous lesson</A> covered how to dance in that way. When the music suggests
it, you can also do quick steps on any step (and very quick or very very
quick steps, but that's an advanced topic).

<P>Side steps are especially easy to lead and follow as quick steps. Try
the following sequences (which you should have practiced near the beginning
this lesson).
<UL>
<LI>
tango Box Step - SLOW, QUICK QUICK, SLOW, QUICK QUICK</LI>

<LI>
tango Box Step opened up - same as the above rhythm</LI>

<LI>
tango Box Step with a Stroll in the middle - same as the above rhythm but
do the Stroll SLOW SLOW</LI>

<LI>
Stroll, Stroll, Side Rock - SLOW SLOW, SLOW SLOW, QUICK QUICK</LI>
</UL>
You will find it easier to do quick side steps if you shorten them. Try
this with the previous sequences.

<P>Now shorten your side steps so much that they become steps in place,
and try the previous sequences again. Notice that this turns your Side
Rocks into <I>Cadencias</I> and your tango Box Steps into straight-line
patterns.
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER>
<H4>
Style</H4></CENTER>
If some of these sequences and rhythmic variations seem identical to figures
you know from other ballroom dances, don't be surprised. All walking dances
use some of the same patterns. What makes each dance unique is not its
step patterns but how the patterns are done -- which is why you should
begin each practice session with a style warmup.
