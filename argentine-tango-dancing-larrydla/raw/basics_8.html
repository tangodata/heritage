<I>Lesson Eight</I></H3></CENTER>
All of the basics have now been covered and some material of intermediate
difficulty. From now on all material will be intermediate level, and occasionally
advanced. Among other things, you'll begin to study step patterns that
don't fit neatly into the system of two-step walks framed by a <I>salida</I>
and a <I>resoluc&iacute;on</I>. This system is an aid to learning and analysis
of complex figures, but no system can cover all possible ways to dance
the tango.
<CENTER>
<H4>
the<I> Cort&eacute;</I></H4></CENTER>
If you think of the Chase as a comma and the Tango Close as a period, the
<I>Cort&eacute;</I> is an exclamation point. It is very obvious and showy
and so should be used with restraint. It breaks a complex figure up into
two parts. In fact, the word <I>Cort&eacute;</I> means "break" or "cut."

<P>To do it, do a Forward Rock step (along the line of dance). But keep
your legs apart. Also, on step one bend the knee of your supporting leg
(right if you're a woman, left if you're a man). Keep your free leg straight
(left for women, right for men). The <I>Cort&eacute;</I> is usually done
in the Right-Foot-Inside position, so keep your knees open enough that
your partner's right knee can fit between your knees rather than bumping
them.

<P>Because your supporting leg is bent, your entire body will sink down
a few inches. Be sure to keep your upper body straight, however. Don't
bend in the direction you're moving. Then step back onto your free foot
(left for women, right for men), using your bent leg as a spring to return
you to a neutral position.
<CENTER>
<H4>
Practice and Variations</H4></CENTER>
Do the <I>Cort&eacute;</I> a few times to get familiar with it. Then try
a Backward <I>Cort&eacute;</I> (the woman stepping forward while the man
steps back against the line of dance). Do that a few times. Now try a <I>Cort&eacute;</I>
to the side, toward the center of the dance floor.

<P>Normally you'll do the <I>Cort&eacute;</I> in a SLOW SLOW rhythm. You
can do other rhythmic variations of the <I>Cort&eacute;</I>, including
a QUICK QUICK, SLOW QUICK, or QUICK SLOW rhythm. Only rarely will these
look good but they can occasionally be very effective, especially if you're
performing in a show. You can also do much slower versions of either (or
both) of the two steps. This can be very sensuous, especially if you add
a gentle <I>Zarandeo</I> (Shake) in the middle. Try each of the three types
of <I>Cort&eacute;s</I> you've learned (forward, backward, and side) with
different rhythms.

<P>After the <I>Cort&eacute;</I> becomes well-practiced, you may want to
try showier variations. For instance, if you are stepping forward, you
can lift the heel of your free foot off the floor and point the toe of
your shoe. Be careful; you must have very good body control AND a partner
who gives you time for this decoration.

<P>A related variation when you are stepping forward is to lift your free
foot entirely off the floor, perhaps bending the knee of your free leg.
You should usually only do this in a choreographed performance or at the
end of a dance when the music stops.

<P>Another related variation is usually done only in a show. As the woman
steps forward she can sink way down on her supporting leg, perhaps so far
that the knee of her bent supporting leg almost touches the floor.

<P>A variation of the side <I>Cort&eacute;</I> can be done at the <I>Parada</I>
(Stop). This is the moment at the end of step one, when you've placed all
of your weight on your supporting leg but before you take step two. This
pause can last just an instant, or much longer. During that time you can
point your free foot straight outward, and bend your body in a curve so
that you lean toward your free foot. Be sure to keep your weight centered
over your supporting foot.

<P>Lastly, <I>Cort&eacute;s</I> can be done at other places in complex
patterns, but that is a more advanced topic that should be deferred till
you've mastered the <I>Cort&eacute;s</I> and their variations described
so far.
<CENTER>
<H4>
the Lunge</H4></CENTER>
The Lunge is very similar to the <I>Cort&eacute;.</I> The only difference
is that it is built upon the Chase rather than the Rock step. In other
words, on step two you bring your free foot up beside your supportting
leg and unbend your supporting leg as you place your weight on your free
foot.

<P>In every other way they are identical, with the same variations. Read
the previous section and try doing Lunges rather than <I>Cort&eacute;s</I>.
<CENTER>
<H4>
the Stab</H4></CENTER>
<I>La Pu&ntilde;alada</I> (the Stab) is related to the <I>Cort&eacute;</I>
and the Lunge. It's a stationary figure you will usually do between basic
steps. To do it bend your supporting leg as much as you would on a side
<I>Cort&eacute;</I> and point your free leg straight out to the side. Your
heel should be lifted and only the toe of your shoe touching the floor.
Then drag your free foot back to the neutral position while straightening
your supporting leg back to its usual slightly flexed state.

<P>The Stab exactly as described is difficult to lead and is more often
done as part of a choreographed routine. You can try to lead it by slowing
lowering your body and tilting your head to look down at your foot as you
extend it and drag it back. Your partner will know what to do only if she
has encountered this figure before.

<P>However, you can lead it as part of a false start: step to the side
but reverse direction before you put more than a little bit of weight on
your stepping foot.
<CENTER>
<H4>
the <I>Parada</I></H4></CENTER>
You learned in the section on <I>Cort&eacute;s</I> about the <I>Parada</I>
(Stop) at the halfway point in the <I>Cort&eacute;</I> and the Lunge. Don't
confuse this with the <I>Dramatica Pausa</I> (Dramatic Pause) that you
can do after a basic step, in the neutral position before another basic
step. In the Pause both your knees are bent only slightly, and your feet
are together. In the <I>Cort&eacute;</I> and Lunge one leg is bent a fair
amount and the other not at all, and your feet are apart.

<P>The <I>Parada</I> is the starting point for a number of intermediate
and advanced figures. The next two sections introduce some of the techniques
behind the figures that use <I>Paradas</I>.
<CENTER>
<H4>
the Foot Drag</H4></CENTER>
The <I>Arrastre</I> (Foot Drag) can be used in a number of ways. You need
a teacher to learn them the minimum pain. This book will only discuss one
or two ways and focus on some important aspects of the Foot Drag.

<P>Try this. Do a Forward <I>Cort&eacute;</I>. At the <I>Parada</I>, the
man should push down lightly wherever his hands and arms touch his partner.
This is the cue for the woman to stay put while he does something.

<P>If you are a man, relax your arms so that they don't pull on your partner
and complete the <I>Cort&eacute;. </I>In the neutral position, move your
left foot so that the side of your shoe touches the side of her shoe, the
one on the foot she has extended toward you. Now you can drag her foot
to your left.

<P>But first you have to move your body to the left so that the two of
you will come together properly when she finishes her part of the <I>Cort&eacute;</I>,
after the Foot Drag.
<CENTER>
<H4>
the Sandwich</H4></CENTER>
The word <I>Barrida</I> literally means Bite. It's the act of sandwiching
one of your partner's feet between your feet.
