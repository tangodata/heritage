Graduation and After</H4></CENTER>
In <U>Argentine Tango Dancing</U> you've been introduced to all the basic
elements of the Argentine tango and to some intermediate material. If you've
studied all the material, practiced most of it, and done some actual dancing
(as opposed to practicing), congratulate yourself. You've graduated.

<P>What comes next? More study, practice, and dancing, of course. You've
received something like an artist's palette of paint and some paint brushes.
The number of colors and brushes in a paintbox are small but with them
you can make masterpieces of tremendous subtlety and complexity. But you
have to master the tools first, a process that never ends. So it is with
the tools you've learned, your dancer's "paintbox."

<P>It would be a good idea to start at Lesson One and go through all the
material again. You will understand things that you didn't before, and
understand better things you thought you fully understood. And you need
to practice each of the elements of tango so that you don't think about
them when you dance. So that you just do them, stimulated by the music
and your partner and your surroundings. And you'll find that you'll sometimes
surprise yourself doing things you never knew you could do.

<P>I also encourage you to get <A HREF="http://www.hooked.net/~tangoman/revu-1.htm">videotapes</A>
to study and to take lessons with other teachers after you've mastered
the basics of the Argentine tango. What I've presented in this book is
just one view of tango, my own. There are many other teachers, each with
their own view of tango. Be wary of those who claim to have the One and
Only Truth; they are fools or frauds. Indeed, the fact that there is no
official organization that polices tango is one of it's strengths. After
more than a century, tango is still healthy, growing and evolving.

Your Future in Tango</H4></CENTER>
What's in your future, beside more studying? Perhaps you'll read books
about tango and Argentina, and buy lots of music and listen to it. You'll
go to see the increasing number of <A HREF="http://www.spe.sony.com/Pictures/SonyClassics/tango">movies</A>
that have tango dancing. Some of it will make you laugh (or cry) because
the dancing is so Hollywoodish and inauthentic, not the real tango that
you know. You'll quickly get to know other tango dancers; the tango world
is small and most dancers eager to welcome new <I>tanguistas</I> into their
ranks.

<P>It's also a fast-growing world, and you will be one of the pioneers.
You'll go to tango shows, perhaps take lessons from the world-class professional
dancers in them, be depressed you can't do the show tango moves as well
as they can and elated that you can do some of them not badly at all. You'll
support or even help organize tango events, maybe perform or teach, take
part in <A HREF="http://tile.net/lists/tangol.html">discussions on the
Internet</A>. You'll dance tango in other cities, maybe even travel to
Argentina. And chances are you'll enjoy yourself tremendously and in ways
you can't with any other dance.
