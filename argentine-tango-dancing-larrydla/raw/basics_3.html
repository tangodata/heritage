Style</H4></CENTER>
You should now be practicing regularly. Start practice sessions with a
style warmup, using the jungle-cat image as a core for the tango style
elements. Take several deep breaths before you start moving. Do the <A HREF="basics_2.html#AgilityExercises">agility
exercises</A> mentioned in Lesson Two: heel raises and cross-step marching
in place. Walk forward, backward, and to the side. Walk in straight, curved,
and sharply curved lines. Focus on only one element at a time and move
as slowly as you&nbsp;<A NAME="FlexLegs"></A>can.

<P>A third tango-style element is a smooth, flowing walk. To do this flex
your legs slightly, lowering your height an inch or two. Straighten a leg
and step forward, keeping your upper body at the same level throughout
the step, with no bouncy up-and-down motion. This adds to your feline appearance.
The flexing of your legs also compresses your leg muscles and makes them
biological springs. This helps you "spring" into each step quicker and
easier and change directions better.

<P>It's harder to walk backward and keep the smooth flow. Try it now, keeping
your weight on the front of your feet and your body directly over your
supporting foot. Straighten your leg a little more than you normally would
when walking backward and reach back a little more than you normally do.

Inside and Outside Position</H4></CENTER>
So far you've been dancing in the Right Foot Inside position used in most
partner dances -- your right foot between and in front of your partner's
feet, your partner's body a few inches to your right and parallel with
your body.

<P>The Argentine tango is unusual in that often you'll be dancing in the
Right Foot <U>Outside</U> position -- your partner's body further to your
right and your right foot outside their feet. Your lower body will still
be positioned to move along the line of dance, but you should twist your
upper body slightly to the right to keep it parallel with your partner's
upper body.

<P>This twist is uncomfortable if kept for very long, so you'll usually
go back to the RFI position within a few steps, or even to a Left Foot
Inside or (more usually) Left Foot Outside position. (Working on the Left
positions is better delayed till you become completely comfortable at dancing
the right-side positions.)
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER>
<H4>
From Inside to Outside and Back</H4></CENTER>
There are several ways to go from the Right-Foot-Inside to the Outside
position and back to the Inside position again. The easiest is on the first
step of the Stroll.
<CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER>

<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="100%" >
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>If you're a man, step left forward at a slight diagonal
to your left on the first step, just enough so that on your second step
your right foot will be outside your partner's feet. Remember to twist
your upper body slightly to the right.&nbsp;

<P>If you're a woman, simply walk straight back as you normally would,
twisting your upper body slightly to your right in the middle of the first
step.&nbsp;

<P>You can get back into the Right-Foot-Inside position in a similar way.
If you're a man, step left forward at a slight diagonal to your right on
the first step of the Stroll, just enough so that on your second step your
right foot is back inside your partner's feet.&nbsp;

<P>If you're a woman, simply walk straight back as you normally would,
untwisting your upper body in the middle of the first step.&nbsp;

<P>Practice going outside and inside, first just as described above. Then
add one or two Strolls between the "bookends" of the two Strolls where
you go outside and back inside. Then practice walking in curved lines as
you would on a dance floor.&nbsp;

Out on the <I>Salida</I>, In on the <I>Cruzada</I></H4></CENTER>
An often-used way to go to the Outside position is with the L-Shaped walk,
usually when it's part of the <I>Salida</I>. There is also another way
to go to the Inside position that you must learn, a variation of the Chase
step.
<BR>&nbsp;
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="100%" >
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>If you're a man, take a slightly longer-than-normal step
to your left on the first step of the L-Shaped Walk, twisting your upper
body slightly to your right. The twist will hold your partner back so that
her side step is slightly shorter than normal.&nbsp;

<P>If you're a woman, you should feel your partner hold you so that you
take a slightly shorter-than-normal step to your right. Be sure to twist
your upper body to keep it parallel with his.&nbsp;

<P>The man as well as the woman should read and do the following instructions
on how the woman goes inside with the Chase. You must understand a step
to lead it, and this is one of the harder patterns to learn.&nbsp;

<P>Step straight back with your right foot. Cross your left foot in front
of your right and place it beside your right foot, so that the outsides
of your feet are close together. This is <I>la Cruzada</I> (the Cross).
As your weight comes onto your left foot, the calf of your left leg will
force the right foot back. Bring your right around so that you're standing
in the neutral position, weight on your left foot.</TD>

&nbsp;
<BR>It may help you if you count ONE AND TWO AND while doing the woman's
Chase step. The ONE is where you change weight on Step One. The first AND
is where you cross, the TWO is where you change weight on Step Two, the
second AND is the return of your right foot to the neutral position.

<P>If you're a man, all you have do with your feet is an ordinary Chase
Step. But you also have to lead the woman's Cross Step properly. Count
ONE AND TWO AND. The ONE is your first change of weight on Step One. On
the first AND twist your upper body to the left, to the straight-ahead
position it normally has in the RFI position. This is your partner's lead
to do her cross step. On TWO do the second step of the Chase. On the second
AND -- and this is very important -- wait for your partner to get fully
into the neutral position.
<CENTER>
<H4>
Practice</H4></CENTER>
Now you must practice what you've just learned about going outside on the
L-Shaped walk and back in on the Chase. If you're a woman, you should practice
the Chase with the <I>Cruzada</I> by doing several in a row. Try doing
this slowly at first, making sure you're doing it correctly. Then try doing
it faster as it becomes more automatic. Some of your partners may lead
the Chase very fast and you need to be prepared for that.

<P>Practice this sequence.
<UL>
<LI>
<I>Salida</I> going to the outside position, Chase Step with a <I>Cruzada</I>
to go back to the inside, Tango Close</LI>
</UL>
Some teachers use this eight-step sequence as their basic "step." Unfortunately
this leads beginning tango dancers to mechanically do this sequence over
and over, without any regard for the music or the obstacles on the dance
floor. To keep from developing this bad habit, vary this sequence by adding
one or more Two-Step Walks before and after the Chase, as in the following
sequence.
<UL>
<LI>
<I>Salida</I> going to outside position, a Stroll, Chase Step with a <I>Cruzada</I>

<I>Adornos</I>: Toe Taps</H4></CENTER>
In Lesson Two you learned how to <A HREF="basics_2.html#SlowsPauses">spice
up your dancing</A> by varying the SLOW SLOW rhythm with even slower steps
and dramatic pauses. You also learned to add spice with an <I>Adorno</I>
(Adornment) called the <I>Zarandeo. </I>It&nbsp; is only one of several
kinds of <I>Adornos</I>. All are done between steps, when your feet are
in or near the neutral position.

<P>One kind is <I>Golpes</I> (Toe Taps). Normally when you take a step
your foot glides along just above the floor as it moves through the neutral
position. But you can also do a <I>Golpe</I> as your foot nears the neutral
position on a forward step or when standing still. Tilt your foot and tap
the floor with the toe of your shoe. You can vary the force of your tap.
You can also vary the height your lower leg bounces after the tap, but
be sure you keep your knees together and let only the lower leg bounce.
If you're dancing on a nearly empty floor or performing in a show you can
do a bounce that kicks your leg as far back and high as your physique allows.

<P>On a crowded floor you should avoid doing <I>Golpes</I>. Instead do
<I>Golpecitos</I> (Little Toe Taps). These are done with a level, not a
tilted foot, so that the tap is done with the ball of your foot or the
underside of your toes. The tap can be hard enough to make a click or so
soft it barely kisses the floor. And, unlike <I>Golpes</I>, you can do
<I>Golpecitos</I> walking backward as well as forward.

<P>Be sparing with <I>Adornos.</I> Too much spice is as bad as too little.
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER>
<H4>
Practicing <I>Adornos</I>: When Stopped</H4></CENTER>
Now you should practice toe taps in all their variety. Also, experiment
with different ways of using them. Here are some for when you're not moving;
this is easier than when moving because you only have to focus on the <I>Adornos</I>.

<P>If you're a man, lead your partner to a stop. After a Single-Step or
a Two-Step Walk your left foot will be free. After a Tango Close you can
adjust your weight so that either of your feet are free, but it's usually
better to free up your right foot. Straighten your legs and lift the shoulder
over your free foot. This tells your partner that the two of you are not
going anywhere immediately, and that she can do <I>Adornos</I> with her
free foot.

<P>What <I>Adornos</I> she does and how she does them is totally up to
her, so you should make sure she has room behind her if she decides to
do any kind of backward kick.&nbsp; Give her time to do <I>Adornos</I>,
then drop your lifted shoulder back to its normal position and flex your
legs slightly. This tells her to prepare to move again.

<P>If you're a woman and you feel your partner lead you to a stop, straighten
his legs, and lift the shoulder over your free foot, you know that he's
giving you the chance to do <I>Adornos</I> with that foot. He should wait
for you to do at least one, then when you feel him drop his lifted shoulder
back to its normal position and flex his legs again you know you must be
ready to move.

<P>What <I>Adornos</I> you do and how you do them is totally up to you.
However, it's a good idea to glance over your shoulder and make sure you
have room if you want to do any kind of extravagant backward kicks. The
leader should have made sure you have this room but not all leaders will
or will do it properly. Here are a few ideas: two very quick <I>Golpes</I>
followed by a high rebound from the last <I>Golpe</I>, three slow <I>Golpecitos</I>,
one <I>Golpe</I> straight behind followed by one behind your supporting
foot.

<P>Both men and women man can do <I>Adornos</I>. And there are several
kinds beside toe taps which you'll learn about later. These include <I>Rondes</I>
(making circles on the floor with the toe of your shoe), and shoe shines
and leg caresses (where you use your shoe or leg to rub your partner's
shoe or leg).&nbsp;<A NAME="RhythmDancing"></A>
<CENTER>
<H4>
Practicing <I>Adornos</I>: While Moving</H4></CENTER>
You can also do <I>Adornos</I> while moving. Normally you should do only
a few during a dance, the way you would limit any kind of spice. However,
you can use <I>Adornos</I> frequently during certain kinds of very rhythmic
music, such as that done by the famous band of Juan D'Arienzo. He was called
<I>"el rey del compas"</I> -- the king of the beat. There are <A HREF="music_list.html">two
excellent CDs</A> of his music which you can get for practice and dancing.
You'll also find him on most collections of music by famous bands.

<P>With such rhythmic music you can do a <I>Golpecito</I> between every
step. You can also break the stylistic rule taught at the beginning of
this lesson, of smoothly flowing motion. To emphasize the between-step
beats of the music you can give a little bounce of your entire body, or
do a side-to-side tilting of your upper body, or exaggerate the normal
contrabody motion of your arms and shoulders to make a sailor-like swagger.
Try this now. Focus on the first method of emphasis, then the second, then
the third.
<CENTER>
<H4>
Dancing</H4></CENTER>
By now you should appreciate that in tango there's no such thing as simply
walking. When you're dancing -- and this lesson is over so it's time for
you to do that -- if you remember any of the stylistic tips learned so
far, do them and play with them. But remember that you're not supposed
to be studying or practicing now. You're supposed to be listening to the
music and your partner's "body language" and having fun.
