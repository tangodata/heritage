A Deeper Look</H4></CENTER>
In this -- last -- lesson we'll fill in some blanks in previous lessons
and go deeper into some material. Then we'll see how you can use what you've
learned in two dances closely related to tango: the <I>milonga</I> and
<I>tango vals</I>.

<B><I>The Keys to Leading and Following</I></B></H4></CENTER>
Before now all the commentary on leading and following has focused on mechanics.
Now we'll explore important&nbsp; "spiritual" skills. I'll use language
that assumes the leader is a man and the follower a woman, but this is
purely for convenience.

<P>The most important leading and following skill is awareness of your
surroundings. Even the best and most considerate of your fellow dancers
make mistakes and can annoy or even hurt you. Tango is especially dangerous
because many dancers learned (directly or indirectly) from show dancers
who don't need this awareness skill. Performers tend not to teach floorcraft,
and teach patterns that are big, fast-moving, and ignore the line of dance.
Keep your head up unless absolutely necessary and even then tilt your head
down just just an instant at at time. Keep your head turned to one side
(generally to the left for men and the right for women) but occasionally
turn it to the other side. If you're leading, lead figures that turn a
lot so that both of you get a wider view of those near you. If you're following,
be ready to resist your partner if he tries to lead you into danger. A
smart leader will appreciate your help.

<P>At the same time you must also be aware of your partner. It's obvious
why followers must have this ability, but it's equally important for leaders.
You must know where she is before you can get her to where you want her,
and you must notice where she deviates from the path you're shaping for
her so that you can get her back into that path. The best follower in the
world isn't perfect, nor will you ever be a perfect leader, and there are
plenty of distractions on even a lightly crowded dance floor.

<P>Like any skill this one improves with practice; when you're dancing
try to remain aware of your partner. At the beginning of the dance before
you begin moving (and at any dramatic pauses during the dance), close your
eyes briefly and focus on the places where you touch your partner. Focus
on your balance and stance and how they are affected by how you connect
with your partner. Readjust your arms and hands and body to improve the
situation. If you feel comfortable doing so, make your readjustment a subtle
caress or squeeze. This heightens your own and your partner's awareness
of your emotional and physical connection. While moving, defocus your eyes.
It may take a little practice; if you wear glasses it can help to take
them off. Defocussing lets you see the large actions that might be dangerous
but reduces visual detail and the attention it demands of you.

<P>For men it's essential that you know very well what you want your partner
to do. Without intending to, you will then subliminally communicate your
certainty and knowledge in a variety of ways. This will comfort her and
make her move more surely, and in the specific ways that you desire. To
gain this knowledge, always watch when women are taught their part. It's
also very helpful to do the woman's part, especially if you can get an
expert leader to lead you in doing it. It also helps if you practice with
an imaginary partner, visualizing what she will be doing. This is not easy,
but with practice you can do it. At the very least imagine where you want
her upper body to go during the figure. Generally if you lead her upper
body correctly she will place her feet as you require.

<P>For women it's essential that you NOT know what your partner wants you
do. Focus on your connection to him, on your balance, and on staying over
the balls of your feet. This will help keep your attention away from thinking
about where and how you will move. For the same reason, focus on the music,
especially the underlying beat. Try to step on the beats when you move,
but resist very slightly being moved. This will stimulate your partner
to be more definite in his leading as well as physically tightening your
connection to him. Try to remain alert but relaxed. This will be harder
if you have an inexperienced leader for a partner but it will become easier
as you improve the focussing skills discussed in this paragraph.

<P>If you're studying this section with a partner, now would be a good
time to stop and dance a few minutes, trying out the techniques taught.

<B><I>Adornos: Rondes and Boleos</I></B></H4></CENTER>
Another <I>Adorno</I> is the <I>Ronde</I> (Round). These are circles which
you make on the floor with the tip of your shoe. Try this: with your left
shoe-tip make a six-inch counterclockwise circle. Now with your right shoe-tip
make a clockwise circle. Then with your left shoe make several circles
that grows larger each time around; do the same with your right foot.

<P>Closely related to the <I>Ronde</I> is an intermediate-level <I>Adorno</I>
called the <I>Boleo</I>. To do one, begin a circle with your left shoe
that starts small but grows larger and continues behind you. Keep your
knees together and point the toes of your left foot. See if you can make
an arc on the floor ending with your lower leg straight out to your right
side. You'll have to twist your lower body to do this, but keep your upper
body facing forward. Then bring your left foot back to the neutral position.
Also try doing the <I>Boleo</I> with your lower leg in the air. Now, do
the same thing with your right foot.

<P>If you're a woman and wearing heels, try a variation the <I>Boleo</I>.
Make it small enough that you can tuck your free foot in behind your supporting
foot.

<P><I>Rondes</I> and <I>Boleos</I> are done more often by women, but men
can do them too. They can be done when walking forward; <I>Boleos</I> can
be done after a side step and can be not only spontaneous but led (though
that is a more advanced topic). They are more usually done when stopped.
They provide the basis for some advanced tango dance figures (and are good
agility exercises!).

<H4>
The Reverse L</H4></CENTER>
There is one more basic pattern to learn: the Reverse L-Shaped Walk. It
is the reverse of the L-Shaped walk that makes up the second part of the
U-Shaped <I>Salida</I>.
<BR>&nbsp;
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="100%" >
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>&nbsp;If you're a woman, step back right, then side left.
If you're a man, step forward left, then side right.&nbsp;

<P>This is similar to the Tango Close, but don't confuse it with that pattern.
It doesn't have the third closing step which gives the Tango Close the
feeling that makes it a good way to end complex patterns. You use the Reverse-L
in the middle of a complex pattern, not at the end.&nbsp;

<P>Here are some patterns you should try.&nbsp;
<UL>
<LI>
L-Shaped Walk, Reverse-L, Stroll.</LI>

<LI>
L-Shaped Walk, Reverse-L, Side Rock, Stroll.</LI>

<LI>
L-Shaped Walk, Side Rock, Reverse-L. Then repeat.</LI>
</UL>
Notice when you repeat the last pattern that the Reverse-L and the L-Shaped
Walk following it give the effect of a Side Rock, but toward the outside
of the dance floor.</TD>

</TABLE>

<CENTER>
<H4>
<I>Adornos: </I>Shoe Taps and<I> Elevadas</I></H4></CENTER>
Now try the last two patterns again, but this time at the end of each side
step do a new kind <I>Golpecito</I>. Rather than tapping the floor with
the ball of your foot, tap the <U>side</U> of the shoe on your supporting
foot with the side of the shoe on your free foot. This is called the<I>
Zapatazo</I> (Shoe Tap).

<P>The <I>Elevada</I> (Elevation) is another kind of <I>Adorno</I>: lifting
your feet higher off the floor than good tango style normally requires.
Try dancing this way now with some music, with just a Forward Stroll. How
high and often you step should be dictated by good taste, the situation,
and the music. You must also be careful when you're in an Inside position
not to do high Elevations with your inside foot, lest you hurt your partner!

<P>When you do <I>Ochos</I> the same thing goes: normally you should keep
your feet near each other near the floor as they pass during the pivots.
However, you can also do Elevations at that point. This swings your lower
leg up till it points straight back or even higher. This turns your <I>Ochos</I>
into <I>Ochos Picante </I>(Spicy <I>Ochos</I>). Practice this now a few
times.
<CENTER>
<H4>
Short Zigzags</H4></CENTER>
The three major ways to vary steps are doing them in inside or outside
position, pivots before and/or after steps, and shortening or lengthening
steps. You could, for instance, shorten the second step of a Zigzag, turning
it from something like a Stroll to something like a Chase.

<P>If you're a man, do a Zigzag without a partner and shorten the second
step into a cross in front of your left foot. Follow through to the neutral
position by bringing your left foot around behind your right.

<P>If you're a woman, do a Zigzag without a partner and shorten the second
step into a cross behind your right foot. Follow through to the neutral
position by bringing your right foot around in front of your left.

<P>Now try this with a partner. Be sure you do the first step of the Zigzag
in Left Foot Outside position. This will keep your feet from interfering
with your partner's on the cross step and on the follow-through.

<P>Now try this again with the following change. If you're a man, lengthen
the first step a bit and lift your right arm slightly as you start your
second, cross-front step. This leads your partner to do an <I>Elevada</I>
during her cross-behind, turning her shortened Zigzag almost into a Backward
<I>Ocho Picante</I>.&nbsp; If you're a woman, when you feel the man lift
your left arm as you start your second, cross behind step, do an <I>Elevada</I>
before you set your left foot down, turning your shortened Zigzag almost
into a Backward <I>Ocho Picante</I>.
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER>
<H4>
The Triple-Step Zigzag</H4></CENTER>
In Lesson Five you learned the <A HREF="basics_5.html#OpenedBox">opened-up
Tango Box</A> step and (<A HREF="basics_5.html#QuickSteps">near the end</A>)
how to change the Opened Tango Box into a straight line by shortening the
side steps to steps in place. There is another variation that's a combination
of this "narrow" Opened Tango Box and the <I>Ocho</I> Zigzag. Try it now
as follows.

<P>If you're a man, pivot right 45 degrees and step forward left. Then
do two steps in place, pivoting a total of 90 degrees to your left. Step
forward right and do two more steps in place pivoting a total of 45 degrees
to your right.

<P>If you're a woman, pivot right 45 degrees and step back right. Do two
steps in place, pivoting a total of 90 degrees to your left. Step back
left and do two more steps in place pivoting a total of 45 degrees to your
right.

<P>You can do this with an all-slow rhythm, a SLOW QUICK QUICK rhythm,
or an all-quick rhythm.
<CENTER>
<H4>
Backward Step Patterns</H4></CENTER>
You've seen that all the patterns that go forward (from the leader's viewpoint)
also have variations that go to the <A HREF="basics_5.html#SideSteps">side</A>.
They also have variations that go backward (while the woman goes forward).
You've already learned most of them, including the Single Step, Rock Step,
Zigzag, and <I>Ocho</I>. Backward patterns are important for a couple of
reasons. They exercise a different set of muscles (or in a different way)
and let other muscles rest so both partners can dance longer. Also, backward
step patterns give dancers a more varied dance "palette" and so are esthetically
important.

<P>The Backward Stroll is especially useful because it's fairly easy to
do. Leaders can use it often with the Turning Forward and&nbsp; Backward
Rocks (the way you learned to do Backward Zigzags in <A HREF="basics_4.html">Lesson
Four</A>).&nbsp; Thus you can do a 360-degree turning walk along the line
of dance. This gives you a 360-degree panoramic view of the other dancers
and helps you prevent collisions and near-collisions.

<P>The Chase (Forward as well as Backward) is also important. It's abrupt,
almost jerky, feeling is useful for certain kinds of bouncy music such
as that of D'Arienzo or <I>milonga</I> music. This feeling also makes the
Chase useful as a "punctuation" device. It's rather like a comma in a sentence
(and the Tango Close is like a period).
<CENTER>
<H4>
A Plethora of Patterns</H4></CENTER>
With all you've learned you can now make dozens or even hundreds of complex
patterns. Here are just a few.
<UL>
<LI>
Turning Forward Rock, Backward Stroll, Turning Backward Rock</LI>

<LI>
Turning Forward Rock, two to four Backward Strolls curved to make a counterclockwise
circle</LI>

<LI>
Turning Forward Rock, two to four Backward Chases curved to make a CCW
arc or circle</LI>

<LI>
A Backward Chase with the woman doing a Forward <I>Ocho</I> to his right
(very similar to the Back-Rock, Forward-<I>Ocho</I> pattern <A HREF="basics_4.html#BackRock">near
the end</A> of Lesson Four). Make the Backward Chase very smooth and slow.</LI>

<LI>
A counterclockwise pivot varying from slight to 90 degrees, then the previous
pattern</LI>

<LI>
A CCW arc or circle made of several of the previous pattern</LI>

<LI>
A Turning Forward Rock with a clockwise upper-body twist near the end to
lead the woman into a Right-Foot-Outside position</LI>

<LI>
The previous pattern, the Backward-Chase / Forward-<I>Ocho</I> pattern
just learned, forward counterclockwise half circle make with one or two
Strolls</LI>

<LI>
Forward Chase, Backward Chase (or vice versa). You can pivot before or
after each Chase to make several variations.</LI>

<LI>
Turning Forward Rock, Backward Chase, forward clockwise half-circle</LI>
</UL>

<CENTER>
<H4>
<I>Milonga</I></H4></CENTER>
The <I>milonga</I> uses all the steps and techniques of the tango, but
it's usually done in a QUICK QUICK rhythm and in a bouncy, swaggery style.&nbsp;
Some people think the <I>milonga</I>, slowed down and made a smooth dance,
birthed&nbsp; the tango. Whatever the truth, the <I>milonga</I> is so historically
important that tango dance parties are called <I>milongas</I> and dedicated
tango dancers are more often called <I>milonqueros</I> than <I>tangueros</I>.

<P><I>Milonga</I> music is often played at tango dance parties and you
won't have to be left out if you learn to dance the <I>milonga</I>. It's
also a happy, high-energy dance that you'll probably want to learn for
its own sake. You'll need <A HREF="music_list.html">music to practice it</A>
at home. However it's usually danced fairly simply and you can probably
pick it up just by watching.

<P>Watch out for the people when you do the <I>milonga</I> even more than
when doing tango. It moves faster so you have less time to avoid collisions.
It's also easy to get so caught up in the rhythm that you forget the other
dancers.

<P>Here are some dance patterns that you can use. You can probably make
up many more; just remember that the <I>milonga</I> has no pauses or stops
and usually only <I>Golpecitos</I> for adornment.
<UL>
<LI>
<I>Salida</I>, Tango Close</LI>

<LI>
<I>Salida</I>, <I>Cadencia</I>, Tango Close</LI>

<LI>
Turning Forward Rock, Backward Stroll or ZigZag or <I>Ochos</I>, Turning
Backward Rock</LI>

<LI>
<I>Salida</I>, Chase, Stroll, <I>Cadencia</I>, Tango Close</LI>
</UL>
The advice in Lesson Three on dancing to very rhythmic music such as D'Arienzo's
also applies to the <I>milonga</I>. <A HREF="basics_3.html#RhythmDancing">Review
it now</A>.
<CENTER>
<H4>
Tango <I>Vals</I></H4></CENTER>
The tango <I>vals</I> (waltz) is simply a tango written in 3/4 time rather
than the more usual 4/4 time. It is usually played as fast as a Viennese
waltz, so you normally dance it with a step on the ONE beat of the ONE-two-three
beats of each measure. This lets you dance slowly and do some of the more
elaborate tango figures.

<P>Occasionally you can throw in triple-step pattern such as the Triple-Step
Zigzag, done in QUICK-QUICK-QUICK rhythm. It's also fairly easy to do a
SLOW on one measure of music and a QUICK-QUICK on the next measure.

<P>Normal tango style is fine for the tango <I>vals</I>. But the <I>vals</I>
is normally played in a fairly steady rhythm, so you can use some of the
<A HREF="basics_3.html#RhythmDancing">rhythm techniques</A> from Lesson
Three but in a more subtle way. You can also do a bit of waltz-like up-and-down
motion. This is especially easy with the Cradle-Rocking step; this pattern
is the same as the conventional waltz Balance Step.

<P>Some of the most beautiful, happy, and romantic tango music was written
as a tango <I>vals</I>. Two of the CDs on the <A HREF="music_list.html">recommended
music list</A> includes several especially nice ones.
