These Web pages will help you learn to dance the Argentine tango. I have presented all information so that it will be easy for you to learn and use. Later material builds on previous material and on knowledge and skills you have from areas outside dance. Also, only the bare minimum that you need to know is covered at any particular time.

<p><b><i>Argentine Tango Dancing</i></b> covers several subjects, including tango step patterns. I have broken such patterns down into a few very simple patterns of no more than three individual steps. I also show you a few easy ways to vary and combine these very basic patterns. This lets you understand and learn new complex patterns very quickly and easily. It also lets you make up your own!

<p>The "steps" of a dance are the most visible part of it, so every new student is eager to learn them. But even if you learn hundreds of steps, you will only look silly if you learn nothing else about the dance. So these pages also help you learn the unique style of the Argentine tango, how to lead and follow, and how to navigate around the dance floor. You will also learn a little bit about one of the most important parts of any dance -- its music.

<P>These pages are organized into lessons that might take you a half-hour
to work through. Then you should practice what you learned until it feels
natural. I believe you will be amazed at how much you learn, and how quickly. After the first lesson, for instance, you should be able to go to a tango dance party, dance for the entire evening, and have a good time.

<p>Sound fantastic? Go to your first lesson and see for yourself!
