&nbsp;Style</H4></CENTER>
The last major element of good tango style is an erect upper body and a
lifted head. This improves your appearance, helping (for instance) to keep
you from looking as if you have a double or triple chin! It also improves
your balance and control, needed for the harder dance figures you'll someday
want to do. Most importantly, tango is a dance with an attitude -- pride
and independence -- and this helps you show it.

<P>To get this posture do this exercise. Let your upper body sag, your
head flop forward so that your chin touches your chest, soften your knees
so that you go into a half-squat, and empty your lungs completely. Now
unfold from the feet upward, breathing in and out slowly but deeply. Straighten
your legs and position your weight over the balls of your feet. Open your
hands and trail your fingers up the sides of your legs as if your fingers
hold an invisible net that passes through your body and pulls it erect.
Continue the motion of your hands upward,&nbsp; straightening your spine
as you "lift" everything inside your upper body with the imaginary net
as it sweeps upward. As your hands rise above your shoulders imagine that
the net pulls your head upward till it lifts your entire body as far as
it can comfortably go. Extend your arms straight above your head and stand
on tiptoes, filling your lungs completely.

<P>Then "let go" of the net and let your arms slowly drop down to hold
an imaginary partner in dance position,&nbsp; keeping your shoulders back.
Let out your breath but don't let your lungs collapse completely. Lastly,
settle back onto your feet and flex your knees <A HREF="basics_3.html#FlexLegs">as
taught</A> in Lesson Three. Do this exercise several times, each one a
little less dramatic. At each practice session do this sequence during
the warmup.

<P>Two or three times each time you go dancing do a discreet version of
the exercise. Touch your belt buckle with the fingertips of one hand and
casually run them up the front of your body till they touch your chin,
using the imaginary net to straighten your upper body and lift your head.

Zigzags</H4></CENTER>
The Argentine tango uses a lot of pivoting steps, where you twist your
body to the left (or right) before or after a step and lift your heel off
the floor. The twist spins your body in the direction of the twist on the
ball of your foot. You stop the spin by controlling the speed and force
of the twist and by lowering your heel to the floor when you've reached
the place where you want to stop.

<TD VALIGN=CENTER>The Zigzag is a basic pattern that uses pivots. It is
yet another variation of the Two-Step Walk. The man moves forward along
the line of dance while the woman moves backward.&nbsp;

<P>If you're a woman, begin by pivoting to your right 45 degrees. Step
back right and pivot to your left 90 degrees. Step back left and pivot
to your right 45 degrees. Follow through to the neutral position.&nbsp;

<P>If you're a man, begin by pivoting to your right 45 degrees. Step forward
left and pivot to your left 90 degrees. Step forward right and pivot to
your right 45 degrees. Follow through to the neutral position.&nbsp;

<P>The two 45 degree pivots and the 90 degree pivot cancel out and you
end up facing in the same direction you began.</TD>

Backward Zigzags</H4></CENTER>
You may also do a Backward Zigzag (backward from the leader's viewpoint).
Since this would take the two of&nbsp; you against the LOD, the leader
should first reverse direction. There are several ways to do that. One
is with the man doing a variation of the Forward Rock Step (and the woman
doing a variation of the Backward Rock Step).
<BR>&nbsp;
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="100%" >
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>If you're a man, pivot 45 degrees to your left. Step forward
left and pivot 90 degrees to your left. Step back right and pivot 45 degrees
to your left.&nbsp;

<P>If you're a woman, pivot 45 degrees to your left. Step back right and
pivot 90 degrees to your left. Step forward left and pivot 45 degrees to
your left.&nbsp;

<P>The man and woman have done two 45 degree pivots and a 90 degree pivot
to the left. This adds up to 180 degrees, so you end up facing opposite
to the direction you began.&nbsp;

<P>Now you can do a Backward Zigzag, a reverse image of the Zigzag going
forward.&nbsp;

<P>If you're a man, begin by pivoting to your left 45 degrees. Step <U>back</U>
left and pivot to your right 90 degrees. Step back right and pivot to your
left 45 degrees. Follow through to the neutral position.&nbsp;

<P>If you're a woman, begin by pivoting to your left 45 degrees. Step <U>forward</U>
right and pivot to your right 90 degrees. Step forward left and pivot to
your left 45 degrees. Follow through to the neutral position.&nbsp;

After doing one or more Backward Zigzags, reverse directions again. You
can do this with a Backward Rock turn, a reverse image of the Forward Rock
turn you just learned. Before the first step pivot 45 degrees to the left.
Take the first step (forward right if you're a woman, back left if you're
a man). Pivot 90 degrees to the left and take the second step (back left
if a woman, forward right if a man). End with another 45 degree pivot to
the left.

<H4>
Variations and Practice</H4></CENTER>
Since Zigzags are a Two-Step Walk, beginning and ending with your weight
on the same foot, you can combine them with any other Two-Step Walk in
any order and number. Here are a few patterns you can make from the Zigzag.
Practice each without a partner, then with a partner (imaginary if you
can't do otherwise) before you go on to the next pattern.

<P>Do four Zigzags (eight steps) as described above, moving straight along
the line of dance, walking forward if you're a man, backward if you're
a woman. When you do this without a partner, focus on doing exactly 45-degree
and exactly 90-degree pivots. When you do this with a partner, focus on
keeping your upper body parallel with your partner but as much as possible
square (perpendicular) to the line of dance. In other words, your lower
body will twist away from the line of dance more than your upper body.

<P>Notice that you have to open your frame slightly to keep from stepping
on your partner's feet. Notice also that on the first step of each Zigzag
you are walking in Left Foot Outside position, and on the second step in
the Right Foot Outside position.

<P>Now do the Forward Zigzags but curving the overall direction to the
left (or right). You can do this to turn a corner or avoid an obstacle.

<P>Lastly do a Rock to reverse directions, two Backward Zigzags, and another
Rock to reverse directions again. (Two Zigzags with the leader going backward
are usually all that's safe to do.)
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER>
<H4>
<B><I>Ochos</I></B></H4></CENTER>
You may create variations of the Zigzag by varying the angle of the pivots.
If you make them less than 45 and 90 degrees, the Zigzag straightens till
it almost becomes a Stroll.&nbsp; You can also increase the angles to a
bit more than 90 and 180 degress. This "squashes" the Zigzag so much that
you end where you began. If you then trace the path your feet made on the
floor it will look like the number eight. Thus this extreme version of
the Zigzag is called the <I>Ocho</I> (Eight) or the Figure Eight. When
stepping forward you're doing Forward <I>Ochos</I>, when stepping backward
Backward <I>Ochos</I>.

<P><I>Ochos</I> are very widely used in the Argentine tango, so you should
practice them till they become natural. Do both Forward and Backward <I>Ochos</I>.
Be sure when you do this that you are wearing shoes with leather or hard
rubber soles, not soft rubber soles; otherwise you may hurt an ankle. Also
make sure the floor is neither too slick nor too sticky. Rest your hands
against a wall, pretending that the wall is your partner.

<P>Try to keep your upper body parallel to your partner and turn your lower
body as sharply to the right or left as you comfortably can. As you become
better you will use your partner less and less for balance. Finally you
will be able to do <I>Ochos</I> all by yourself. You will master Forward
<I>Ochos</I> first because they are easier than Backward <I>Ochos</I>.
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER>
<H4>
<B>Leading and Following</B></H4></CENTER>
Leading and following is done mostly with your upper body, with your arms
and hands just extensions of your body. Let's more closely examine what
happens when the man does a Forward <I>Ocho </I>while the woman does a
matching Backward <I>Ocho</I>.

<P><U>Man's:</U> You signal the beginning of the <I>Ocho</I> by twisting
your upper body slightly to your right and beginning to move to your right.
Twist your lower body 90 degrees to your right, step forward onto your
left foot, and pivot your lower body 180 degrees leftward on your left
foot. As you pivot twist your upper body slightly to your left and begin
to move to your left. Step forward onto your right foot and pivot your
lower body 90 degrees rightward on your right foot. Bring your upper body
to a straight-ahead orientation to signal the end of the <I>Ocho</I>.

<P><U>Woman's:</U> You should feel the leader twist your upper body slightly
to your right and begin to move to your left. Respond to this lead by twisting
your lower body 90 degrees to your right and stepping backward with your
right foot. As your weight comes fully onto your right foot, you should
feel the leader twist your upper body slightly to your left and begin to
move to your right . Respond to this lead by twisting your lower body 180
degrees to your left and stepping backward with your left foot. As your
weight comes onto your left foot you should feel the leader twist his upper
body to face straight along the LOD. Respond to this by twisting your lower
body 90 degrees to your right and twisting your upper body to parallel
his.
<CENTER>
<H4>
<B>Leading/Following with Hands</B></H4></CENTER>
Though the man's upper body does most of the work of leading, it can be
helped by the man's right hand (placed under the woman's shoulder blades
approximately centered on her spine). Here's how.

<P>If you're leading, as you twist your upper body to the right at the
beginning of your Forward <I>Ocho</I> turn your right hand so that the
heel briefly presses against your partner's back. Similarly, when you twist
your upper body in the opposite direction (left) before the second step,
turn your hand so that your fingers briefly press against her back. At
the end of the figure again press the heel of your hand briefly against
your partner's back.

<P>If you're following, as the leader twists his and your upper body to
your right at the beginning of your Backward <I>Ocho </I>you may feel his
hand behind you press on the left side of your back to help you turn to
your right. Similarly, before the second half of your Ocho you may feel
his hand press on the right side of your back to help you turn to your
left. At the end of the figure you may again feel pressure on the left
side of your back to help you turn to the right.
<CENTER>
<H4>
<A NAME="BackRock"></A><B>Other Ways of Using <I>Ochos</I></B></H4></CENTER>
Often the woman does a Forward <I>Ocho</I> on the man's right side while
he does a Backward Rock, keeping his feet apart (right foot forward) for
extra stability. This pattern has intermediate-level difficulty.

<P>This can be done after you've done any Two-Step Walk. If you're already
in the Right Foot Outside position, you can do it immediately, but if you're
in the Right Foot Inside position you must first go to the RFO position.
If you're a man, you do that by twisting your upper body slightly to your
left. If you're a woman, you should feel your partner twist your upper
body to the left; respond by pivoting your lower body slightly to your
left.

<P><U>Woman</U>: You should feel your partner step backward, leading you
to step right forward in the Right Foot Outside position. Then you should
feel his upper body twist to the right and a brief pressure on the left
side of your back. This is your cue to pivot to your right 180-plus degrees
on your right foot. You should feel him step forward, which is your cue
to step forward left to return to the spot where you began. Lastly you
will feel him twist your bodies to the left, leading you to pivot 180-plus
degrees so that you face him again. He may or may not lead another Forward
<I>Ocho</I>.

<P><U>Man</U>: You should read the previous paragraph and do the woman's
part; this will help you understand what you must lead.

<P>You do the first part of the lead by simply stepping back, but it will
help your partner if you press the fingers of your right hand briefly into
her back. As your weight comes down fully on your left foot, twist your
upper body about 90 degrees to your right and at the same time briefly
press the heel of your right hand into your partner's back, turning her
180-plus degrees. Return your weight to your right foot, pulling her forward
with you. Untwist your upper body to return to facing along the line of
dance, using the heel of your right hand to help turn her upper body parallel
with your's. You can then lead another Forward <I>Ocho</I> if you want.
