## _Lesson Eight_

All of the basics have now been covered and some material of intermediate difficulty. From now on all material will be intermediate level, and occasionally advanced. Among other things, you'll begin to study step patterns that don't fit neatly into the system of two-step walks framed by a _salida_ and a _resolucíon_. This system is an aid to learning and analysis of complex figures, but no system can cover all possible ways to dance the tango.

### the _Corté_

If you think of the Chase as a comma and the Tango Close as a period, the _Corté_ is an exclamation point. It is very obvious and showy and so should be used with restraint. It breaks a complex figure up into two parts. In fact, the word _Corté_ means "break" or "cut."

To do it, do a Forward Rock step (along the line of dance). But keep your legs apart. Also, on step one bend the knee of your supporting leg (right if you're a woman, left if you're a man). Keep your free leg straight (left for women, right for men). The _Corté_ is usually done in the Right-Foot-Inside position, so keep your knees open enough that your partner's right knee can fit between your knees rather than bumping them.

Because your supporting leg is bent, your entire body will sink down a few inches. Be sure to keep your upper body straight, however. Don't bend in the direction you're moving. Then step back onto your free foot (left for women, right for men), using your bent leg as a spring to return you to a neutral position.

### Practice and Variations

Do the _Corté_ a few times to get familiar with it. Then try a Backward _Corté_ (the woman stepping forward while the man steps back against the line of dance). Do that a few times. Now try a _Corté_ to the side, toward the center of the dance floor.

Normally you'll do the _Corté_ in a SLOW SLOW rhythm. You can do other rhythmic variations of the _Corté_, including a QUICK QUICK, SLOW QUICK, or QUICK SLOW rhythm. Only rarely will these look good but they can occasionally be very effective, especially if you're performing in a show. You can also do much slower versions of either (or both) of the two steps. This can be very sensuous, especially if you add a gentle _Zarandeo_ (Shake) in the middle. Try each of the three types of _Cortés_ you've learned (forward, backward, and side) with different rhythms.

After the _Corté_ becomes well-practiced, you may want to try showier variations. For instance, if you are stepping forward, you can lift the heel of your free foot off the floor and point the toe of your shoe. Be careful; you must have very good body control AND a partner who gives you time for this decoration.

A related variation when you are stepping forward is to lift your free foot entirely off the floor, perhaps bending the knee of your free leg. You should usually only do this in a choreographed performance or at the end of a dance when the music stops.

Another related variation is usually done only in a show. As the woman steps forward she can sink way down on her supporting leg, perhaps so far that the knee of her bent supporting leg almost touches the floor.

A variation of the side _Corté_ can be done at the _Parada_ (Stop). This is the moment at the end of step one, when you've placed all of your weight on your supporting leg but before you take step two. This pause can last just an instant, or much longer. During that time you can point your free foot straight outward, and bend your body in a curve so that you lean toward your free foot. Be sure to keep your weight centered over your supporting foot.

Lastly, _Cortés_ can be done at other places in complex patterns, but that is a more advanced topic that should be deferred till you've mastered the _Cortés_ and their variations described so far.

### the Lunge

The Lunge is very similar to the _Corté._ The only difference is that it is built upon the Chase rather than the Rock step. In other words, on step two you bring your free foot up beside your supportting leg and unbend your supporting leg as you place your weight on your free foot.

In every other way they are identical, with the same variations. Read the previous section and try doing Lunges rather than _Cortés_.

### the Stab

_La Puñalada_ (the Stab) is related to the _Corté_ and the Lunge. It's a stationary figure you will usually do between basic steps. To do it bend your supporting leg as much as you would on a side _Corté_ and point your free leg straight out to the side. Your heel should be lifted and only the toe of your shoe touching the floor. Then drag your free foot back to the neutral position while straightening your supporting leg back to its usual slightly flexed state.

The Stab exactly as described is difficult to lead and is more often done as part of a choreographed routine. You can try to lead it by slowing lowering your body and tilting your head to look down at your foot as you extend it and drag it back. Your partner will know what to do only if she has encountered this figure before.

However, you can lead it as part of a false start: step to the side but reverse direction before you put more than a little bit of weight on your stepping foot.

### the _Parada_

You learned in the section on _Cortés_ about the _Parada_ (Stop) at the halfway point in the _Corté_ and the Lunge. Don't confuse this with the _Dramatica Pausa_ (Dramatic Pause) that you can do after a basic step, in the neutral position before another basic step. In the Pause both your knees are bent only slightly, and your feet are together. In the _Corté_ and Lunge one leg is bent a fair amount and the other not at all, and your feet are apart.

The _Parada_ is the starting point for a number of intermediate and advanced figures. The next two sections introduce some of the techniques behind the figures that use _Paradas_.

### the Foot Drag

The _Arrastre_ (Foot Drag) can be used in a number of ways. You need a teacher to learn them the minimum pain. This book will only discuss one or two ways and focus on some important aspects of the Foot Drag.

Try this. Do a Forward _Corté_. At the _Parada_, the man should push down lightly wherever his hands and arms touch his partner. This is the cue for the woman to stay put while he does something.

If you are a man, relax your arms so that they don't pull on your partner and complete the _Corté._ In the neutral position, move your left foot so that the side of your shoe touches the side of her shoe, the one on the foot she has extended toward you. Now you can drag her foot to your left.

But first you have to move your body to the left so that the two of you will come together properly when she finishes her part of the _Corté_, after the Foot Drag.

### the Sandwich

The word _Barrida_ literally means Bite. It's the act of sandwiching one of your partner's feet between your feet.
