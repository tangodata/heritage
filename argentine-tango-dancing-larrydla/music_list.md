## _Dance Music_

Try to get any of the following CDs at a major music store; most will order if they don't have a selection. You may also mail-order from **[Mark & Joan Tango Events](http://home.att.net/~mark-joan-tango)**, (800) 600-8644, **[Puente al Tango](http://www.tangobridge.com/dtango7)**, (207) 846-9872; **[The Tango Reporter](http://members.aol.com/tango4you/alltango/catalog.htm)**, (213) 654-6268.

A collection of several bands is a good start. Then if you especially like one you can get more of that band.

-   **Bueno Aires by Night**. _EMI Odeon_. Beautiful, danceable works by some famous Argentine tango bands. Includes several good _milongas_.
-   **Instrumental Tangos of the Golden Age**. _Harlequin_. Also terrific. There are no duplicates of works on previous CD, so you can profitably get both.

Each of the following CDs focuses on only one (and in one case two) artists or bands during the "Golden Age" (the 1940s plus and minus five years) when tango reached it greatest popularity in Argentina.

-   **La Melodia de Nuestro Adios**. _El Bandoneon_. Francisco Canaro's band. Many good tangos, _milongas_, and tango _valses_. If you get only one CD, get this one.
-   **Quinteto Pirincho**. _El Bandoneon_. Another of Francisco Canaro's bands but with a diffent sound. Every single selection is excellent. Includes four _milongas_ and a tango _vals_.
-   **Ausencia**. _EMI Odeon_. Osvaldo Pugliese's band. One of the most famous modern tango composers who (unlike Astor Piazzolla) always wrote & performed for dancers. Contains a wonderful instrumental version of the most famous tango _vals_: _"Desde el Alma."_
-   **Nelly Omar & Francisco Fiorentino**. _El Bandoneon_. Unusual in that all selections include singing and are excellent for dancing. Half the CD is devoted to Omar, the other to Fiorentino. Contains Omar singing _"Desde el Alma."_
-   **El Rey del Compas**_. El Bandoneon._ Band of Juan D'Arienzo: "The King of the Beat," with strong rhythms.
-   **King of Rhythm**_. Harlequin._ More D'Arienzo. Get one but not both D'Arienzo CDs.
-   **Orquesta Tipica Victor**. _El Bandoneon_. One of the loveliest recordings. Very strong beat, excellent for practice OR dancing.

In the earliest years of the tango's growth in popularity in Argentina and elsewhere (the 1920s & 30s) many Argentine bands toured the world. Some of the very best are in the following CDs, with many excellent digitally re-mastered works.

-   **Buenos Aires to Berlin**. _Harlequin_. 1927-39.
-   **Buenos Aires to Madrid**. _Harlequin_. 1927-41.
-   **Tango - Le Tango a Paris**. _Frémeaux & Associés_.  Two CDs (1907-41).
