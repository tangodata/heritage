**Argentine folk music and dance** developed **much before the arrival of tango**, mixing the styles of song and dance of indigenous people, colonial settlers from Europe (mostly Spain), and African slaves who all started settling into the newly formed country during the 17th century.


The arrival of tango put the Argentina on the cultural map of the world, and since the early 1900s, this dance became one of the most popular Latin dances worldwide. Developed by the underclass of Argentina and Uruguay, and under influences of numerous European, African and indigenous styles (such as [milonga](/tango/milonga-dance/)), tango quickly became one of the foundation stones of modern Argentine culture and music.

## Argentine Folk Music

Argentine folk music is today known under several names, most notably**folklore music**, **folkloric music**, or **folklórica**. It exists not as a single musical entity, but as a mix of numerous styles and forms that differ one from another by the influences of the region, climates and local traditions of the parts of Argentine where they were developed. The exact origins of the any of those individual regional styles are now lost to time, but modern versions of those styles can be traced to individual influential artists and composers who have contributed to the modern development of those styles.

Traditional folklore instruments are guitar, violin, and drums. Some music styles also use [bandoneón](/tango/bandoneon/) (best known for its use in tango music), and indigenous Andean instruments such as **wooden flute “quena”** and **small banjo “charango”**. Clothing is focused on traditional Argentinian outfits, with women wearing long and full skirts that allow movement, while men wear wide gaucho pants that get narrow at the ankles (bombachas), wide brim hats, boots, and scarves. Some dances require dancers to hold scarves in hand.

## History of Argentine Folklorica

### Early history

During the majority of the history of **Argentine folklorica**, this musical style existed only as a part of the non-written tradition of Argentine heritage. It only received the name “_folklorica_” during the middle of 19th century, coming from the English word folklore. While in rest of the world “folklore” describes a wider expressive body of culture that was shared by particular nation or group of people, in Argentina this word is only used to describe “folklorica”, diverse folk music and dances of this large country.

For centuries, folk music and [dances of Argentina](/tango/argentine-dances/) were not recorded in written form. This changed during the early 20th century with the exploits of **Andrés Chazaretta** (today known in Argentina as the “patriarch of folklore”) who developed a group “Conjunto de Arte Nativo” (“_The Collection of Native Art_”) which was focused on preservation, recording and showcasing of the Argentine folklórica across entire country. Their first highly successful tour happened in 1906, kickstarting larger movement of preserving Argentine musical and dance heritage, and creation of many other musical groups which were focused on developing new traditional music of Argentina.

### 20th century

The modern history of Argentina featured numerous**political changes**, which influenced or **restricted cultural development**, created rises and falls in preservation and popularization of heritage and cultural values of this country. This enabled folklorica (together with tango and other traditions of Argentina) to become strongly linked with regional and national identity during the 1950s and 1960s when Argentine folklore underwent through a significant revival that is today often referred as “boom del folclore”.

During that time, many new bands, authors, singers, and composers started producing brand new songs in the traditional styles of regional Argentine folklore. Their efforts were boosted by the new recording and playback technologies, political regime that was focused on the promotion of traditional Argentine identity, as well as the more urbanized population that was hungry to consume new music via radio, television, and cinema.

The years of “Boom del folclore” eventually crystallized into the “Movimiento del Nuevo Cancionero” (The New Singer Movement) that lasted between the 1960s and 70s, featuring the rise of many popular Argentine folk singers and musicians such as Armando Tejado Gomez, Toto Francia, Oscar Matus and Mercedes Sosa. They all managed to mix the elements of traditional Argentine folk music, tango, and rock into new forms of popular music.

### 1970s-1980s Dirty War and Folk Music

Change in government regime between 1976-1983 led to the return of the system that **repressed any form of free artistic, cultural and political expression** that subverted the image of the government. This led to the **banning of the numerous folk songs** because of their non-approved subversive lyrics, government-backed disappearances of artists, intellectuals, political opponents, and exile of many notable folk musicians such as Carlos Carabal, Los Tucu Tucu, Cantores del Alba, Atahualpa Yupanqui, Los Hermanos Ábalos, Manseros Santiagueños and others.

During those years, numerous **Argentinian music artists tried to openly defy the will of the government** and their censorship measures by performing the banned songs, which in some cases led to the reprisals by government forces. One of the most notable examples of this is the rumored assassination of the famous folk musician Jorge Cafrune who **was killed in a hit-and-run accident shortly after he sang an unapproved song.** Other performers who tried to do the same were often harassed by the government or police personnel, or even interrupted and arrested during live performances (such as folk singer Mercedes Sosa and his entire audience in Mar del Plata in 1979).

After the early 1980s, government pressure against subversive songs slackened, and many exiled folk musicians returned to Argentina which then underwent another age of promotion of traditional values. Folk music was reintroduced to people hungry for traditional values, and new generations of composers, musicians and singers promoted folklorica into one of the most popular musical styles of modern Argentina.
