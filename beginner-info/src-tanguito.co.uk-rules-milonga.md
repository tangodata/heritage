15 unspoken rules at a milonga (1/3)

Whether you’ve been to a Milonga before or you’re yet to experience your first one, these tips have been devised especially to fill you in on all the etiquette so that you feel more comfortable and just soak up the lovely atmosphere. Things can be confusing in all the hustle and bustle of a Milonga so hopefully this will clear up anything that may catch you out on the night. If there’s anything we’ve missed, you’re more than welcome to leave us a comment and we’ll be happy to add it to our list!

Part One of Three

1. Only ever say “thank you” at the end of a tanda – If you say “thank you” after a song, whilst you’re just being polite, your partner might interpret it as “I’m done dancing with you”. Instead try, “I really enjoyed that dance”, or if you didn’t “lovely weather today wasn’t it”, or “I like your shoes”. Remember “thank you” actually means “no more thanks”.

2. Always wait until the song’s finished before moving on – Whether it’s approaching the end of a tanda or you’re very unhappy with your partner’s skills (or lack of…) to the point where you intend to leave him, you should try and wait until the song has finished. You may not feel like being polite if your partner is pushing and pulling you around and crushing all life out of your feet – but if you can, grin and bear it!

3. Follow the line of dance – Being a spontaneous style of dance, tango requires careful planning to minimise collisions. It’s like an ecosystem: very fragile. If too many dancers disturb the balance, the experience of all is not as nice. All couples should dance in a counter clockwise circular motion, keeping up with the couple in front but allowing space enough for them to do one backwards step and of course plenty of elbow room. Avoid overtaking, or if you feel you have to, please overtake the couple on their left side, so that the leader can see you.

4. Protect your partner – In Buenos Aires, old-school milongueros try and keep their partner with their back to the tables, to protect her from elbows and straying legs. Without going to that extreme, it is the leader’s job to make sure he protect his partner. It takes great trust to be led blindly backwards through a busy dance floor, so leaders, make sure you don’t break that trust by allowing her to get bashed or hurt. Ladies; put all your faith in him, he might be able to feel your resistance otherwise which could knock his confidence and ability to lead.

5. If you knock something over, pick it up – Crash. Crunch. As embarrassing as it is, accidents do happen. So if you knock something over – pick it up, or if you spill someone’s drink – buy them a new one: as simple as that.

Come back soon for the next 5 rules.

Part Two of Three

6. Don’t sit as a couple if you want to mingle – A male and female sitting together makes them out of bounds, especially in Buenos Aires. If you’ve gone to a milonga just to dance with your date or partner then fair enough, be together all you like. However, if you’ve gone together with the intention of dancing with a variety of partners then by making it clear you’re together people will perceive you as being off limits or too risky to approach. It would take one brave man to invite a lady to dance in front of her date/husband. Similarly, if you’re with a member or a few members of the opposite sex then you’re also far less likely to be approached.

7. Ask/accept with your eyes – The traditional way to initiate a dance is for the man to ask the lady to dance using a slight nod called the “cabeceo”. In order for this to work, both members of the opposite sex need to scan the room to decide who they’d like to dance with next. Inevitably your eyes will eventually meet if you both feel the same way. Men; it is your job to signal to the lady that you’d like to dance, by nodding your head whilst looking at her. Ladies, if you are interested, subtly nod your head to accept his invitation.

8. Remember your tango style – You might be working on improving some technique point from your last tango class, or try and practice new steps. Whilst technique should not be preventing you from dancing, always try to have at the back of your head only one point you’d like to improve. You’ll see that you’ll be able to move through your technique points in no time.

9. Don’t rush into it – Don’t start dancing as soon as the music starts. Enjoy the first few seconds of the music to identify the song: do you know it, is it rhythmical, lyrical, how does it make you feel? These few seconds will help set the tone for the dance so it’s time well spent. You will find that regular tango dancers will stand around talking briefly before taking up the embrace and proceeding to dance.

10. Stop when the beat stops – Once you know tango music well enough, you’ll be able to “predict” when the end of the song is coming. It is important to finish dancing on the last beat if possible. Most songs end on two notes “Sol, do”, or “C, G”. It’s always tidier to freeze on the final beat and hold your final position for a few seconds. Some orchestras are cheeky however, Rodriguez typically steals one beat so if you’re not aware, you’ll finish the song late, and Tanturi sometimes takes a long pause between the last two notes. If you pay attention to the music you’re dancing to, you’ll soon be able to identify who is who.

Part Three of Three

11. Always walk a lady back to her table – It is really nice etiquette for a man to escort their partner back to her table or seat at the end of a tanda. It is especially true in Buenos Aires, but wherever you are, try it, it’s such a nice feeling.

12. Stand away from the dance floor if you’re not dancing – Make sure that you don’t stand by the edge of the dancefloor whilst people are dancing. Any tango dancer will appreciate that space is tight at Milongas, so be considerate and stand back.

13. Criticising is for the classroom only – It really is not very nice to criticise, instruct or put anybody’s dancing down at a Milonga. If your partner’s moves are, let’s say, less than ideal, then do your best to fake it. One trick is to try and open the embrace as it then becomes easier to maintain one’s own balance if the other person’s dancing is not very advanced. Comments that are unasked for are often simply unwanted!

14. Collisions; apologise and move on – Even if it wasn’t your fault, a quick sorry will suffice. Likewise, if a couple bump into you, nod to accept their apology or smile it off. Don’t turn it into a competition, remember what’s important – your partner and the music.

15. Dance “al piso” – In a crowded dancefloor, it is really better for everyone to keep adornments, boleos, etc “al piso”, that means on the floor. Leaders, if it’s busy, refrain from leading high energy moves. Followers if you are led moves that you think are dangerous for others, you can always modify your reponse to keep your feet on the floor and make it safe.
