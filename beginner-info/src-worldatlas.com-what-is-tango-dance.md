For many, the country of Argentina is synonymous with tango dance and tango music, which have been popular there for over a century now. The beautiful and distinct dance has constantly been altered and improved but has not lost its Argentine identity and roots. The dance sprung up from the poor, underprivileged areas of Buenos Aires and quickly spread to Europe mainly as a couple dance. Despite the efforts of the conservative group to get rid of the dance in 1955, it gained even more popularity in the 1980s, becoming one of the world’s most popular dance styles.

In the 1800s, Buenos Aires was a hot spot for many immigrants who were visiting Argentina, especially from Europe and Africa.

They began meeting in joints and bars mixing their different cultures with the local Latin music and producing a new style of music which they called tango. A new social dance developed from the new style of musical blend. Initially, the dances were inspired by sexual tension between the revelers and the prostitutes and thus involved emotional undertones with sensuality being a key component.
