Tango Etymology
---------------

The exact origin of the word ‘_tango’_ cannot be located entirely, and many modern historians believe that several events and words shaped the name of this dance. Some of the most popular theories is that tango signified some other style of music that was popular in 17th and 18th century Argentina and Uruguay, that was taken from Spanish language where tango dancing (of a much different style than its modern version) become popular in the 19th century, or that it was taken from some Niger-Congo languages of Africa.

No matter what its exact origins are, the words “ **_tango_**” and “_tambo_” started being used for **naming dance and musical gatherings of slaves** in the region of the basin of River Plata. As this term started gaining popularity, it quickly became a synonym for the entire tango dance and [tango music](/tango/tango-music/) style.

First historical record of the word “tango” can be found in the government proclamation in Argentina dated to 1789, in which authorities place a **ban on “_tango_” musical gatherings** that were frequented by slaves, lower classes of free people living in the port areas of Buenos Aires. The commonplace use of the word Tango in Argentina gained traction around 100 years later, near the very end of 19th century.

Origin of the Tango Dance
-------------------------

The early versions of the dance are not recorded in history, and only the most popular type of dance managed to survive as Traditional Argentine Tango, which also continued to morph and change into other styles over the many years of modern tango’s history.

It is important to mention that the initial burst of popularity of Tango dance was fueled with the emotions of thousands of young immigrant men who arrived in Argentina **searching for better life**. Hundreds of their influenced re-shaped original tango into a modern form that managed to eventually capture the imagination of wealthier Argentine citizens, who managed to spread this incredible dance around the world, starting with their visits to Paris in the early 1900s where this dance quickly became an overnight sensation.

An early form of Tango is thought to be formed in Cuba and Spain in the mid-19th century where they were performed as a solo dance by women. Andalusian tango was performed by one or two pairs of women with castanets, with very strong public frowns and fears that this mix of tango and flamenco was immoral and very flirty.

-----------------------------------------------------

The development of Tango as we know it today started in the mid-1800s after Argentina undergone massive immigration. A mix of the people from Africa, Spain, Italy, England, Poland, Russia and native-born Argentinian created a very potent cultural mix that soon started forming new traditions and a new way of life. One of those newly created things came from the mix of European minuet dances, polkas and many African influences that brought rhythms and instruments that formed Tango, a dance that very quickly became very popular in the poor neighborhood of Buenos Aires in the late 1880s where it was known as “**_music of the immigrants_**”. By mid-1800s, tango becomes a dance of choice during “_conventillos_ ” gatherings (large houses owned by several families, which featured dance halls or open ground suitable for dance gatherings) in the booming city of Buenos Aires. Fueled by closed codes of those houses, particular language used during a gathering, the dance became more and more popular, eventually starting to be danced by actors on the stages of the theater houses.
