The best known of these dances are **native** (derived from the music, dances, ceremonies and celebration dances that were present in South America at the time of the arrival of European immigrants) and **modern folk dances** (which were developed over centuries of development of this large nation).


The development of Argentine music has played a large role in the formation of the modern folk dances that are today practiced in all regions of this country. Here are the most notable dances today practiced in Argentina:

1\. Carnavalito
---------------

The Argentine regions of Altiplano and Puna are known for the development of the traditional South American dance that is today practiced in numerous religious festivities. Since its early development, this dance went through changes that had made it into a mix of the Spanish colonial culture and the indigenous cultures of South America who had practiced this dance long before European settlers arrived at the shores of this country. Instruments that most commonly follow this dance are native instruments such as quena, siku, and the bombo. The **music is very cheerful, quick**, and multiple partners (arranged in groups or rows) follow the beat of the music with smiles. A leader of the row or a dance group (male or female) usually **holds a handkerchief or ribbons in one of its hands**.

Today, Carnavalito public dances are commonly practiced in the northern regions of Argentina, most notably in regions of Salta and Jujuy), as well as in some western parts of Bolivia.
