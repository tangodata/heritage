# Walking Together in a Straight Line

Tango is **walking together**. So let's **walk in a line together**. If the leader walks forward, then the follower walks backward.

You might be tempted to think that this is the most simple **tango figure** or **tango step pattern**, but there is already _significant complexity_ to it. If you look at all possible [stepping possibilities as a couple](navigation-in-couple.html), you can even consider it as a special case of a [sacada](sacada.html). Moreover, we'll see now why in tango it is actually more natural to **walk outside partner**, despite the required [**dissociation**](../walking/embrace-dissociation.html "Dissociation").

## _Walking Inside Partner_, [Parallel System](walking-system.html)

![Walking inside partner: two shared foot lanes](../../../images/tango/walking-in-line/parallel-system-inside.gif)
Walking inside partner: two shared foot lanes. The lines in this diagram represent the [connection](../walking/embrace-dissociation.html) between partners in between steps, not the foot paths.

**Walking inside partner** in [parallel system](walking-system.html "Walking System") means you are in front of each other, mirroring each other's steps. This might seem like the simplest thing to do and is indeed taught everywhere in the **first tango lesson**. A beginning dancer might be relieved because there's no [dissociation](../walking/embrace-dissociation.html "Dissociation") involved, but he soon discovers this is a hard “figure” to pull off elegantly.

When we think in “**foot lanes**” or “**foot tracks**”, there are _two different lanes that we both share._ Hence indeed there is the risk of stepping on the lady's toes, certainly when [leading and following](../walking/leading-and-following.html) skills are still fresh.

## _Walking Outside Partner_: What They Normally Teach You

A stereotypical tango feature is the so-called **walking outside partner**. To help you understand what happens, this concept is mostly explained with _**foot lanes**_. The diagrams show this for **walking outside left**, but **walking outside right** is similar.

[Crossed System](walking-system.html), Walking Outside Left.

Explained like this, there seems to be a huge difference between [parallel](walking-system.html) and [crossed walking system](walking-system.html), and indeed, the first time you'll try this in [crossed system](walking-system.html), it might feel all very complicated and even dangerous ;-).

Nothing wrong with this conceptual explanation, because it helps to visualize and to understand. But in reality, we don't walk in that many lanes, though. We'll see later on _what really happens_.

## Overview

Up till now, we have the following 5 possibilities for **walking in a line** in **tango**:

-   [Parallel System](walking-system.html)
    -   **Left outside**
    -   **Right outside**
    -   **Inside**
-   [Crossed System](walking-system.html)
    -   **Left outside**
    -   **Right outside**

## Looking at It Structurally

If you think **walking in line** is complicated, here's a **simple trick**.

First of all, the _length_ of any step can be chosen without any problem. The leader typically steps close to the [standing leg](../walking/walking.html) of the follower, because it is considered more **beautiful** if the steps are at least that deep. In that case he needs to choose whether to _pass the standing leg_ of the follower **left or right** with every step, irrespective of **his free leg**, and irrespective of **her free leg**. That was the trick. This really is the only **structural complexity** for the leader to handle, and it helps looking at things this way. It's a free and independent choice for every step.

In theory, this yields _eight possibilities_ for continuously **walking together in a straight line** (leader forward, follower backward).

Crossed Zigzag (ocho-like)

No highway because nobody steps like this, except maybe in the “chorizo” way of dancing as he calls it ;-).

The _zigzag_ options are legal but weird and are seldom used.

This table should already make it clear that **alternating sides** is really the stranger option, even for stepping **parallel inside**. Stepping **parallel inside** feels to a beginner as the easy one, because there's no [dissociation](../walking/embrace-dissociation.html "Dissociation") involved. But once you understand the principle of [dissociation](../walking/embrace-dissociation.html "Dissociation") as a natural thing that happens all the time throughout the dance, things will start feeling the other way round.

Also interesting to notice is that once **walking outside**, the [walking system](walking-system.html) really doesn't make that much of a difference. It only does if you [walk with your free hip first](../walking/walking.html "How to Walk"), which is **bad technique**. In that case you'll indeed need more [dissociation](../walking/embrace-dissociation.html) in **parallel outside** than in **crossed outside**.

## Walking Alone

What happens when _**walking alone**_?

When **walking on the street**, most people will walk in two lanes. The farther those lanes are apart, the smaller the chance of tripping over your own foot or trousers, but the less **elegant** (to say the least) the walk will be. It is a complicated dynamic process, where the **center of mass** **[wobbles](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TPLiTb-0KU "Video of Wobbling Robot, Running with Feet in Two Lanes")** a bit from left to right, but all in all it remains pretty much in the middle, because of the fastness and dynamics like swinging of arms.

However, when **walking very slow**, or when **dancing tango**, we will move in between islands of **strong balance**. Remarkably, when standing on one leg in balance, your [standing foot](../walking/walking.html) is not on one side, but rather right **in the middle** under your body, since that's where your center of mass is (approximately). In between steps, our center of mass will thus be exactly [on top of our foot](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZQmjoWzulM "Video of Robot Walking Slowly in Two Lanes and Swaying his Hips a Lot"). We could still step in two lanes, but there is no need for it, as our center of mass would have to [sway from left to right](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxsbJhOdkrQ "Video of Robot Walking Slowly in Two Lanes and Being Very Inelegant"), which is never **elegant**.

Therefore it is only natural that a **tango walk** is **in one lane**, **on a straight line** (no wobbling from left to right). We are walking in one lane, except for the moment were we overtake our standing leg with the free leg: we need some space there to pass through with our [free foot](../walking/walking.html).

## What Really Happens When Walking Outside Partner

Because of all this, what happens with the **foot lanes** in reality is quite different from what they generally tell you.

It turns out that **walking outside partner** allows for both dancers to stay in their own private 100% straight lane!

Not so when **alternating sides**: it is impossible to both **walk in a straight line**. At least one dancer will have to _**zigzag**_ a bit. Absolutely legal tango when done correctly, but not really 100% walking in a line.

This explains why the more experienced dancers may prefer **walking outside** (mostly in **[crossed system](walking-system.html "Walking Systems: Parallel and Crossed")**) to **walking inside** (**in front**) in **[parallel system](walking-system.html "Walking Systems: Parallel and Crossed")**.

## Conclusion

What looked like simply **walking in front of each other** is more like a **zigzag**\-experience than you might think. It is impossible to perform this without a light **swaying motion** for at least one of the partners.
