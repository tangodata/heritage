# Waltz Rhythm

## Splitting in two

Rhythmically speaking, the most natural thing to do is to split durations in **2 equal parts**. Often songs alternate between verse and chorus (2 things), each containing 4 (2x2) phrases, each spanning 4 bars, each containing 4 beats, that many instruments still divide in 2 or 4 to play notes on.

Always 2. A lot of music is based on this principle. A lot of contemporary dance music has 32 bars of this, 64 bars of that. But also a lot of our **tango** and **milonga** music has only multiples of 2 in its rhythm.

## Splitting in three

Now the next simple thing to do after 2 is 3. On a slow level, we can introduce some asymmetries and variations in the song structure level (3 verses for instance). On a fast level, we can have all kinds of embellishments in the music that play three notes where there would have been two. Not [quick-quick-slow](traspie.html), but the three notes each taking the same amount of time.

Comparison:

X...........X (Interval between two heavies that we'll divide in three )
q..q..s.....X (quick-quick-slow)
X...x...x...X (perfectly divided in three equal parts)

Tango and milonga doesn't need anything else. Then what is different in Waltz?

## Waltz

First of all, the division in 3 exists completely in its own right and is not played against a backdrop of 2 on other instruments (which makes life actually easier), and so there will never be a switch back to a division in 2 or 4 during the song.

What this really means now, is that we have **one heavy, and two lights** in between the heavies**.** These are called the beats and are counted 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3, with 1 for the heavy beats as always. This is a completely different feel than non-waltz music.

On a faster and slower level however, still everything is divided in 2.

Secondly, the **division in three** happens on a level of about **normal stepping speed**: it is a duration of more or less a second that gets divided in three.

Now this makes stepping to it interesting! What can we do?

**1**23**1**23**1**23**1**23
S..S..S..S.. Stepping **only on the heavy beats (only slows)**
Ss.Ss.Ss.Ss. **“Echoing” traspié** all the time
S..Ss.Ss.S.. Only sparsely an **“echoing” traspié**
S.sS.sS.sS.s **“Preparing” traspié** all the time (something like a very slow “[shuffle](syncope.html)”)
S.sS..S.sS.. Only sparsely a “**preparing traspié**”
S.sS..Ss.S.s Alternate between both types of “**traspié**”
SssSssSssSss Stepping on every beat, some sort of _“_**double traspié**”. The normal thing to do in non-tango waltz.
S.sSs.SssS.s Alternate between everything.

And if we start leaving out _heavies_, it'll become some sort of [syncopation](syncope.html) in waltz!

The important thing to remember here, is that a **traspié** in waltz can be done in **two very different ways**, each with a completely **different feel** to it. It is a bit of a challenge to [lead](../walking/leading-and-following.html) the difference, although very well possible, and important in **tango waltz**. We can do traspiés wherever we want, as in normal tango. And as an extra, we can **alternate between the two types**.

Stepping on every beat is a hallmark of normal waltz, but in **tango waltz** it is too much of a good thing.
