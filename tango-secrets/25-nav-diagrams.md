# Couple Movement: Visualization in Diagrams

The **diagrams** on this page depict the movement, the turning and the navigation of the **tango dancing couple** when they perform **one step together**. So we'll visualize **[all possible step combinations](navigation-in-couple.html)** of both partners that keep them at the [same distance](../walking/embrace-dissociation.html) of each other. That really is 99% of the **tango vocabulary**.

## How the Stepping Diagrams Work

### Four Footprints

Both dancers will have a **weight-bearing foot** before the **step**, and they'll have a **weight-bearing foot** after the **step**. Hence you'll see four footprints in the diagrams.

### Foot position

The footprints are just there to indicate the **position of the feet**, not the orientation: they are not pointing in the right direction. To know the direction, the [individual stepping directions](steps-individually.html) have to be consistent with the rules of the [stepping directions in a couple](steps-in-couple.html). Moreover, there are always two **foot directions** to consider: before and after [collecting the feet](../walking/collecting.html), because that's when the pivoting happens.

### Lines Showing _Connection_ instead of _Step_

In most traditional **dance stepping diagrams** you'll find the feet of the same person connected with an arrow. The diagrams on this page are a bit unusual though: the lines between the feet depict the **connection lines** before and after the step, rather than the **stepping lines** of each individual.

I think this is the most revealing way of showing the **structure of the dance**. As a price, it takes a little more deciphering to discern the individual steps: just connect the man's footprints for **his steps**, and the woman's footprints for **her steps**.

## Stepping Diagrams

Always two **connection lines**: one before and one after the **simultaneous step**

### Along

![Tango Argentino | Simultaneous Step | Diagram](../../../images/tango/steps/1_along/img0.png)
Along, same step length, no turning.

![Tango Argentino | Simultaneous Step | Diagram](../../../images/tango/steps/1_along/img2.png)
Along, different step length, some turning.

![Tango Argentino | Simultaneous Step | Diagram](../../../images/tango/steps/1_along/img3.png)
Along, very different step length, lots of turning.

#### Impossible

![Tango Argentino | Simultaneous Step | Diagram](../../../images/tango/steps/1b_impossible/img1.png)
Impossible step, walk-through.

### Opposite

![Tango Argentino | Simultaneous Step | Diagram](../../../images/tango/steps/2_opposite/img4.png)
Opposite, small step length, little turning.

![Tango Argentino | Simultaneous Step | Diagram](../../../images/tango/steps/2_opposite/img5.png)
Opposite, normal step length, normal turning.

![Tango Argentino | Simultaneous Step | Diagram](../../../images/tango/steps/2_opposite/img6.png)
Opposite, small step versus large step, normal turning.

![Tango Argentino | Simultaneous Step | Diagram](../../../images/tango/steps/2_opposite/img7.png)
Opposite, large step length, lots of turning.

### [Giro](giro-molinete.html)

![Tango Argentino | Simultaneous Step | Diagram](../../../images/tango/steps/3a_giro/img14.png)
Giro, normal step length, normal turning.

![Tango Argentino | Simultaneous Step | Diagram](../../../images/tango/steps/3a_giro/img15.png)
Giro, small step length, little turning.

### [Sacada](sacada.html)

#### Acute Angle of Attack

![Tango Argentino | Simultaneous Step | Diagram](../../../images/tango/steps/3a_sacada_acute/img8.png)
Sacada, acute, inside (a little along), lots of turning.

![Tango Argentino | Simultaneous Step | Diagram](../../../images/tango/steps/3a_sacada_acute/img9.png)
Sacada, acute, inside (a little along), deep entrada, lots of turning.

![Tango Argentino | Simultaneous Step | Diagram](../../../images/tango/steps/3a_sacada_acute/img10.png)
Pseudo-sacada, acute, outside, (a little opposite), lots of turning.

#### Obtuse Angle of Attack

![Tango Argentino | Simultaneous Step | Diagram](../../../images/tango/steps/3b_sacada_obtuse/img11.png)
Sacada, obtuse, inside (a little along), a little turning.

![Tango Argentino | Simultaneous Step | Diagram](../../../images/tango/steps/3b_sacada_obtuse/img12.png)
Pseudo-sacada, obtuse, outside, (a little opposite), a little turning.

#### [Walking In Line](walking-in-line.html)
