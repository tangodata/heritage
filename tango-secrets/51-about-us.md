# About the Author

The articles on this site have been written by a male Argentine Tango dancer. His first Argentine Tango class was in 2002, and after a short pause he followed more than 350 hours of classes and more importantly he has been dancing very intensively at milongas and festivals.

While still a moderate dancer, an interest to really understand the complicated structure of this wonderful dance developed. An analytical approach, experience and lots of study resulted in the creation of this website.

Good luck!
