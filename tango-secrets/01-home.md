# Learning Argentine Tango: a Structural Approach

This website was born out of an ever increasing fascination with **Argentine Tango**. The road to mastery of this subtle and elegant **couple's dance** takes a lot of dedication and time and might sometimes feel quite frustrating. What makes good tango? Feeling? Balance? Togetherness? Technique? The intimacy of the couple's embrace? Being in the here and now? Connection? Soul? Sexuality? Calmness? Expression? Elegance? Musicality?

![Two Tango Shoes](images/tango/ladies-tango-shoe.jpg)This site aims at providing the **intermediate and advanced dancer** with a better understanding of the intrinsic **structure of the dance**. The approach is detailed, technical and advanced. It is intended to give an intellectual **understanding** of some of the harder to grasp concepts.

Main topics covered are: how to **[walk](content/tango/walking/walking.html)**, [**lead** and **follow**](content/tango/walking/leading-and-following.html); a structural analysis of all the **[stepping possibilities](content/tango/structure/steps-individually.html)** and combinations while [**remaining connected**](content/tango/walking/embrace-dissociation.html) as a couple ([**walking in a line**](content/tango/structure/walking-in-line.html), **[walking system](content/tango/structure/walking-system.html), [open step, back cross, forward cross](content/tango/structure/steps-in-couple.html), [giros](content/tango/structure/giro-molinete.html), [sacadas](content/tango/structure/sacada.html)**); and also a lot of explanation on **rhythm**. **[Dos por quatro](content/tango/rhythm/rhythm-basics.html), [milonga](content/tango/rhythm/milonga-rhythm.html)** and **[waltz](content/tango/rhythm/waltz-rhythm.html)** rhythm are explained as to make complicated concepts such as **[syncopation](content/tango/rhythm/syncope.html)** clear to non-musically trained dancers.

![One Tango Shoe](images/tango/ladies-tango-shoes1.jpg)Probably theory is not a prerequisite for music or dancing. But it certainly can help. Some learn by watching, playing or trying. But some want to understand intellectually too. If this applies to you, you've come to the right place. Even many skilled dancers or dance teachers have limited knowledge of the underlying theoretical principles, or at least have a hard time explaining them. I've seen many a teacher with all the rhythm in his dancing, but unable to explain what he just did.

Let's not forget that **Argentine Tango** is a dance of total **improvisation** on the spot. All this knowledge might not be required for some to achieve this goal. But for some it might well be of help.

So stop learning an [eight-step-combination](content/tango/walking/eight-count-basic.html) every lesson: that's no tango. Enjoy true **freedom** with every step by knowing very well [what you can do](content/tango/structure/navigation-in-couple.html) while improvising together.

Un abrazo.
