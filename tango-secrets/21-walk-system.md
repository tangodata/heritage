# The Walking System

## Paralelo versus Cruzado

Suppose both partners step more or less simultaneously. This is what happens most of the time in **tango**, but also when **walking in the park** with someone you like. Then this can be done in either of the following ways:

-   **parallel system (sistema paralelo)**: both were standing on **the opposite foot** (i.e. one on **left** and one on **right**), and thus stepping will happen again on **opposite feet**;

-   **crossed system (sistema cruzado)**: both were standing on the same foot (i.e. both on **left**, or both on **right**), and thus stepping will happen again on **the same foot**.

As always, all stepping happens with the [free leg](../walking/walking.html) (the non-standing leg).

## Changing the Walking System (Not for Beginners)

You will want to change regularly from one system to the other during the dance. How? There really only is one way. One partner should do an uneven number of steps (mostly **one step**) while the other person does not step. In practice this amounts to:

-   the leader leading a step while **skipping one step** himself (no so easy, takes practice)

-   the leader **taking an extra step** (called a “**[traspié](../rhythm/traspie.html)**”) while hiding it (not leading any step).

In both cases, this step needs to be towards one _side_ of the embrace and _around_ the non-moving partner if you want to keep the [connection](../walking/embrace-dissociation.html)'s distance. _Remark just for completeness: this doesn't need to be, because there is a way of changing the distance between your feet while maintaining the upper-body connection, by varying the amount of **forward lean (apilado)**. This is however rather advanced to [lead and follow](../walking/leading-and-following.html) well. It is also a rather modern form of tango, with all of its **volcadas**, **colgadas**, and **carpas**._

Mostly, the leader will lead or do the [**smallest step**](../walking/small-steps-cross.html) possible (a [weight shift in place](../walking/small-steps-cross.html)). In that case, it is only natural to do it in [double tempo](../rhythm/rhythm-basics.html). What does this mean exactly for non-[waltz music](../rhythm/waltz-rhythm.html): that the previous, the extra and the following step would be counted as [quick quick slow](../rhythm/rhythm-language-quick-slow.html#QQS) (see further on). This boils down to inserting an extra step in the middle of the other two, and is called a [**traspié**](../rhythm/traspie.html). In [waltz](../rhythm/waltz-rhythm.html), you want to do this in the music, meaning exactly on 1/3 or 2/3 in between the normal steps.

Furthermore, you typically will want to smoothly maintain **body speed**.

-   If you split consecutive steps when feet **land** on the ground, the **[traspié](../rhythm/traspie.html)** and the next step will both have to be half as long in distance too. This is called a **[chassé step](../walking/collecting.html#chasse)**. Thus one partner does a full normal slow step, the other one does two half length steps at the same time.

-   But in tango-speak, it is much more logical to split consecutive steps when the free leg **[collects](../walking/collecting.html)**, and then the [**traspié**](../rhythm/traspie.html) is a [**very small step**](../walking/small-steps-cross.html) (a weight change with your feet together), and the steps before and after are [**normal steps**](../walking/walking.html).


These are two different descriptions of exactly the same movement.
