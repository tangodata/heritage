# Step Directions (Individual's Perspective)

## What Is Possible?

Everything described here is **relative to the lower body** of an **individual dancer**. The **orientation** of the **upper body** can differ up to 135° due to **[dissociation](../walking/embrace-dissociation.html)**, which aims at keeping the [connection](../walking/embrace-dissociation.html) or at least the orientation between the upper bodies in the couple.

There are three possible **step directions**:

-   **forward;**
-   **backward;**
-   **sideways.**

Actually these each have a small twin brother (a [small step](../walking/small-steps-cross.html) of almost zero-length, but body will still move about 10 cm):

-   a **forward [cross](../walking/small-steps-cross.html)** [step](../walking/small-steps-cross.html) (almost) in place (outsides of feet end up touching after knee of free leg going _before_ the other knee);
-   a **backward [cross](../walking/small-steps-cross.html)** [step](../walking/small-steps-cross.html) (almost) in place (outsides of feet end up touching after knee of free leg going _behind_ the other knee);
-   a step (almost) **[in place](../walking/small-steps-cross.html)** (insides of feet touching), which indeed amounts to the special case of the smallest step **sideways** possible.

Notice for these small versions that the **cross steps** make you go a little **sideways** too, albeit in the opposite direction! After some practice, a backward [cross step](../walking/small-steps-cross.html) can actually make you even go a little bit **forward** and vice versa. To put this differently: you can describe more than an entire circle with your **free foot** around your **standing foot**.

## Pointing Your Feet

There is no need to **point your feet** in any other direction than **forward** (again relatively to the orientation of the lower body): **towards the inside** is always a big no-no; **towards the outside** may add stability and prepares for outward turns, but is more **ballet** than **tango**, and there really isn't any need to do so.

## Stepping Diagonally

You simply don't **step diagonally**. At least not diagonally relative to the **lower body**. You are supposed to **pivot** your lower body very easily and quickly if necessary on the moments your [ankles meet](../walking/collecting.html) (and they always should after every step!). You **pivot** at most 90° just to make sure your step will be **forward**, **backward** or **sideways**. Followers: if the leader neglects to [lead](../walking/leading-and-following.html) this (often small) **pivot** in preparation of an oblique direction, you're still supposed to do it quickly by yourself, just to avoid taking an ugly step. Remember the pivot is ONLY with the **lower body**, therefore rotating **easily**. Since the **upper bodies** always remain [facing](../walking/embrace-dissociation.html) each other, as a consequence the **direction of the upper body** changes much more **slowly**.

## In Diagrams

All **six possible steps** are represented in two diagrams to avoid a cluttered depiction of the **forward cross** and the **backward cross**.

The three small steps coincide with the positions where the [**free leg**](../walking/walking.html) may **[collect in between steps](../walking/collecting.html)**.
