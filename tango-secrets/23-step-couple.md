# Step Directions (Couple's Perspective)

This analysis helps you understand all possibilities of moving with and within a couple while maintaining [connection](../walking/embrace-dissociation.html).

## What Is Possible?

Everything described here is **now relative to the upper body** of a **dancer**, and thus **to the orientation of both upper bodies of the couple** since these **always remain [connected](../walking/embrace-dissociation.html)** in Argentine Tango**.**

Consider the imaginary **connection line** between the two weight-bearing feet of partners (each partner [standing on one leg](../walking/walking.html)). With your free foot you can do:

-   a **front cross** step: you cross that line somewhere in between you. This is in fact (half of) a **front ocho** (but it may not look like one if you will step up close to where partner was standing, especially if partner will step in the same direction as you).
-   a **back cross** step: you cross the extension of that line somewhere behind you. This is actually (half of) a **back ocho**.
-   an **open** step: you don't cross that line
-   **no step**, no weight shift :-). Included because partner may be stepping!

Your partner has the same four possibilities independently of you (although both will be planned and [led](../walking/leading-and-following.html) by the leader).

## Cross Is Cross

Imagine your free foot is chosen, say it is your left one. Then a **front cross** step is **_similar_** to a **back cross** step in that they both will need to be towards your right. An **open** step will have to be towards your left.

## Individual Steps in the Couple's Embrace

We can now combine this stepping within the couple's embrace with what we know on the [directions of steps relative to the lower body](steps-individually.html).

Let's still suppose we always keep the _[connection](../walking/embrace-dissociation.html):_ the _distance_ and the _facing of the upper bodies towards each other_ (no modern tango “**soltadas**” where you break the connection :-().

If you think about it (or try it), you will see that:

-   a **[front cross](steps-in-couple.html)** will always be a **[forward step](steps-individually.html)** or a **[forward cross](steps-individually.html)**;

-   a **[back cross](steps-in-couple.html)** will always be a **[backward step](steps-individually.html)** or a **[backward cross](steps-individually.html)**;

-   an **[open step](steps-in-couple.html)** can be anything: a **[forward](steps-individually.html),** a **[backward](steps-individually.html),** a **[sideways](steps-individually.html)** or their “in place”-equivalents: a **[forward cross](steps-individually.html)**, a **[backward cross](steps-individually.html)**, and an **[in place](steps-individually.html).** However, especially if partner is traveling less distance than you are, it is considered bad style to do a **[forward](steps-individually.html)** or a **[backward](steps-individually.html)**. As an example, you could be stepping around your partner using only **[forward](steps-individually.html)** steps. The better option would be to pivot 90° towards partner after the **[front cross](steps-in-couple.html)** (with the inner foot) so that your feet face him, do the **[open step](steps-in-couple.html)** as a **[sideways](steps-individually.html)** step, and pivot again 90° in either sense, as to prepare for a **[front](steps-in-couple.html)** or **[back cross](steps-in-couple.html)**. This process is called a [**molinete**](giro-molinete.html). All this of course exclusively with the lower body, while [dissociating](../walking/embrace-dissociation.html) to keep the upper bodies [connec](../walking/embrace-dissociation.html)[ted](../walking/embrace-dissociation.html).


This all should have made clear the difference between an [**open step**](steps-in-couple.html) and a **[sideways step](steps-individually.html)**. Example: when [walking in line](walking-in-line.html) (one partner forward, other partner backward) in [parallel system](walking-system.html) and in front of each other ([inside partner](walking-in-line.html)), you're both doing [**open steps**](steps-in-couple.html) all the time, but they won't be **[sideways](steps-individually.html)**.
