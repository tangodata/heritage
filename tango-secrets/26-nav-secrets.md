# Walking Together

## Combining It All

The following table gives an overview of all **possible combinations** for the case when both dancers each perform one step simultaneously.



Leader's free leg: [**left** or **right**](../walking/walking.html)

\--

Leader's step type: **[cross](steps-in-couple.html)** [or **open**](steps-in-couple.html)

\--

Leader's step direction: **[to the left](steps-in-couple.html)** [or **to the right**](steps-in-couple.html) of the embrace

Follower's free leg: [**left** or **right**](../walking/walking.html)

Follower's step type: **[cross](steps-in-couple.html)** [or **open**](steps-in-couple.html)

Follower's step direction: [**to the left** or **to the right**](steps-in-couple.html) of the embrace

Couple's **walking system**: **[parallel](walking-system.html)** [or **crossed**](walking-system.html)

\--

Couple's **step type**: **[similar](steps-in-couple.html)** [or **different**](steps-individually.html)

\--

Couple's **movement**: **[opposite](navigation-in-couple.html)** [or **along**](navigation-in-couple.html)

This remarkable table has an interesting property: all rows and columns are constrained, meaning you can choose independently only 2 out of 3 items. All in all there are 9 variables and 6 constraints with 1 of them redundant. 9-6+1 = 4. This means **you can choose any 4 items you like independently, as long as they don't contain 3 items from the same row or column, and as long as those 4 items don't fit in a T-shape or L-shape**.

**[Giros](giro-molinete.html)**, **[sacadas](sacada.html)** and **[walking in line](walking-in-line.html)** are limit cases.

-   For **[giros](giro-molinete.html)**, two items in the second and the same two items in the third column are **_undecided_**, because one dancer doesn't step.
-   For **[sacadas](sacada.html)**, they can be very close to being **_undecided_**, because one dancer steps towards the other, but normally the dancer doing the sacada chooses a side of the foot that is in the way.
-   For **[walking in line](walking-in-line.html)**, the same applies, but the dancer going backwards always will cause four items in the two rightmost columns to be undecided. It really is the most special case.

There really is nothing else you can do in tango ;-), except when you allow for the breaking of the [connection](../walking/embrace-dissociation.html). An example would be the follower doing some pirouettes in modern tango.

## The Secret of Navigation in Argentine Tango

The real use of this table is that a **beginning dancer** will control the two leftmost colums and be surprised by the outcome, whereas a more **experienced dancer** will be able to **navigate** **freely** by controlling the last column directly.

As an example, consider the bottom row of the previous table. You can only choose two of these three variables if you both step at the same time! In practice you'll be in a [walking system](walking-system.html) (which you could rapidly change if you would want so with a [traspi√©](../rhythm/traspie.html), but let's suppose you don't), you decide to go **[opposite](navigation-in-couple.html)** [or **along**](navigation-in-couple.html), and now whether the step types ([crosses or opens](steps-in-couple.html)) will need to be [similar or different](steps-in-couple.html) can't be chosen anymore.



**[Couple's Movement](navigation-in-couple.html)**

**[Couple's Walking System](walking-system.html)**

**[Couple's Step Types](steps-in-couple.html)**

**along** (if close to partner's old foot: [**sacada**](sacada.html) or [**walking in line**](walking-in-line.html))

parallel

**Similar**, both cross (front or back) or both open

crossed

**Different**: one dancer cross (front or back), other dancer open

**opposite** (if close to partner's old foot: [**sacada**](sacada.html) or [**walking in line**](walking-in-line.html))

parallel

**Different**: one dancer cross (front or back), other dancer open

crossed

**Similar**, both cross (front or back) or both open

**limit** case: **[giro](giro-molinete.html)**

Not applicable (parallel or crossed implies stepping together)

Special case: only one partner steps
