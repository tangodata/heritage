# Couple Movement: to Turn or Not to Turn

Tango is also **turning** a lot, although this is not taught in beginner's classes. What possibilities are there?

This is where tango can get complicated. Since we'll try to maintain the couple's [connection](../walking/embrace-dissociation.html) and distance, we can consider the couple's upper bodies as quite “monolithic”. We will now examine **all possible steps** and **symmetries** with this [connection](../walking/embrace-dissociation.html) as our only _constraint_. For each simultaneous step, there will be a **[rotation axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_centre_of_rotation)** of this single **four-legged body**.

Interestingly, on this page it won't matter at all _which foot leader nor follower is on_! We'll simply step with our [free foot](../walking/walking.html), as always.

## **_Along_** versus **_Opposite_**

We will represent the **connection** by a **line segment**, connecting the supporting (standing) feet of both partners. After the step, this **_connection line_** will have moved to somewhere else. There are three possibilities. The _connection lines_ before and after:

-   don't intersect (I'll call this partners moving **along**);
-   intersect (I'll call this partners moving **opposite**);
-   touch (I'll call this the **limit** case).

Remark: there is no “official” **tango terminology** for this as far as I know.

Examples of all cases are represented in [step diagrams](navigation-in-couple-diagrams.html) on the next page.

### Partners moving **_along_**

-   If both steps have equal length, there will be no rotation of the couple. If not, there can be a lot of rotation (up to almost a **half turn**).
-   We say partners move more or less **in the same direction**.
-   The couple's rotation center will be behind one of the partners, possibly offset to the side.
-   The amount of **couple's rotation** is a result of **difference in step length.**

### Partners moving **_opposite_**

-   The bigger the steps, the more the couple rotates. With small steps, there can be a limited amount of rotation (up to almost nothing).
-   We say the dancers are **turning around each other**.
-   The couple's rotation center will be somewhere in between them, possible offset to the side.
-   The amount of **couple's rotation** is a result of **combined step length.**
-   Example: partners face each other, you both step to your left forward.

### Limit case 1 : the turn ([giro](giro-molinete.html "The Giro"))

-   The ends of the _connection line segments_ meet in the same person: that person stays where he/she is (**no step**) and will be **pivoting** and doing a **giro**, partner stepping around.
-   We say **one dancer turns around the other.**
-   The couple's rotation center will be the non-stepping but **pivoting** partner.
-   The amount of **couple's rotation** is a result of **the step length** of the person stepping around.

### Limit case 2 : **the displacement ([sacada](sacada.html "The Sacada"))**

-   The ends of the _connection line segments_ meet in the other dancer: this is a very interesting case where one person's _step line_ takes the position of the _connection line_, and the connection line moves to where the other person's _step line_ was. This is called a **[sacada](sacada.html)** by this first person. He/she literally follows the path of the other and goes to where this person was standing. At least almost. Since we want to be stepping (almost) simultaneously, this would be impossible without jumping. So this step has to be a little left or right from the leg that will be leaving (**trailing foot**), making a **sacada** always a very small amount of moving either **along** or **opposite**. This doesn't matter in practice, but [**open steps** and **cross steps**](steps-in-couple.html) (for the dancer that does the sacada) get reversed too by this choice, that's all.
    -   Remark about the [step type](steps-in-couple.html) for [sacadas](sacada.html): this is counterintuitive. It might seem logical not to reverse this, and simply use the same [step type](steps-in-couple.html) and [couple's movement](navigation-in-couple.html) for the inside step as for the outside step. However, this would only be consistent with a definition of [step types](steps-in-couple.html) relative to a _line connecting the middles of the stepping lines_ or something like that, instead of _a line connecting the standing feet before the step._ I'll keep on using the latter definition.
-   We say **dancers follow each other** (not in the sense of [leading and following](../walking/leading-and-following.html) though: it is always the leader that leads the step, irrespective whether he does the [sacada](sacada.html) or leads his partner to do so).
-   The couple's rotation center will be **to the side** of the couple, as well before as after the step.
-   The amount of **couple's rotation** is a result of **the “angle of attack”**, typically about 90°. It can be less, but as the _most special case_, we have the couple following each other [**in a straight line**](walking-in-line.html) (**angle of attack** 180°), which is precisely what we do in the first class! If we make the angle of attack still bigger and the sacada “doer” steps to the other side of the _trailing foot_, **along** and **opposite** won't get interchanged, but the **couple's turning direction** gets reversed, albeit while turning little, and [**open steps** and **cross steps**](steps-in-couple.html) (for the dancer that gets the sacada) get reversed too.

## Using Space Wisely in Crowded Milongas

It is obvious that taking **small steps** is always a wise thing to do in crowded places. But which of the bigger steps are the better options?

It is interesting to notice that the **opposite** movement with equal step lengths, with the rotation center somewhere in between partners (“shortest” turn) is actually the most natural thing to do in crowded milongas, since you come rather close to swapping places with partner (**buying and selling space**). Moving **along** on the contrary actually takes up the most place, especially with big steps, since you pretty much both move to a far away new spot.

As an example, in your first **ocho** class, the **leader** typically “**receives**” or “**accompanies**” the **follower's** ochos with [side steps](steps-individually.html) towards the same side (**along**). However, moving (with side steps or own ochos, doesn't matter) in the **_opposite_** direction takes up less space, involves **turning of the couple**, and induces a completely different feel! Try it out!

## The Couple's Turning Sense

A **leftward** move adds **clockwise** rotation of the couple, and likewise does a rightward move adds **counterclockwise** rotation. But if there is movement **along**, the **biggest step** determines the sense of the rotation.
