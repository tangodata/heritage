For those who wonder: as long as you're standing still, pushing force of leader <em>always</em> equals pushing force of follower! So if you think partner is pushing too hard, it's because you're pushing back. As a leader, just get a little closer with your feet if you feel it's too much.</p>
          <p>Often also called<strong> shared axis</strong>, although there is no <strong>axis</strong> involved at all. However, once you're tightly connected with the upper bodies (leaning or not), you'll notice you have to take into account the <strong>shared center of mass</strong> to get the <strong>dynamics</strong> right. This shared center of mass will always have to be somewhere between the two weight-bearing feet. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>When <strong>leaning forward</strong>, this requires good balance left-right. But as a couple, you can still turn around any vertical axis you like.</li>
            <li>When <strong>leaning backward</strong> (see <strong>colgada</strong>) however, also the balance forward-backward will need to be perfect, because there is little room for error for the position of this shared center of mass, since the outline of the weight-bearing feet is a very small surface. In this case turning around each other will have to be around a vertical axis through the center of mass. That'll be the “<strong>shared axis</strong>”.</li>

        <td><p>Normally tango is danced  with a little <strong>leaning forward</strong> into each other. This is called “<strong><span xml:lang="es" class="es" lang="es">apilado</span></strong>” or with <strong>shared balance</strong>. Admittedly, it can be danced without it (both dancers completely in own <strong>balance</strong>; it might be good to master this earlier on in the learning process). But it can also done with a lot of <strong>leaning forward</strong>, meaning the two weight bearing feet of the couple are far from each other. That is a “<strong><span xml:lang="es" class="es" lang="es">carpa</span></strong>".  The leaning forward is relaxed, and the force between the couple is completely horizontal, exactly as when leaning against a wall. You never hang onto your partner, even the follower's arms are never resting fully on the leader!</p>
<p>The amount of “<span xml:lang="es" class="es" lang="es">carpa</span>” can be varied throughout the dance, but this requires advanced following and leader skills. This is what happens in a <strong>volcada</strong> and in an opposite sense in a <strong>colgada</strong>. Also leading and following of <a href="#OchoMilonguero">ochos milongueros</a> requires mastery of playing with the amount of forward lean.</p>
<p>And this forward lean is a very good exercise while both standing on one leg, since its feel and subtle balance is essential to tango. This horizontal force will have to be in the direction of the <a href="walking/walking.html">standing foot</a> (seen from above), otherwise there would be torsional force on both spines and on both supporting feet. You never want that.</p></td>

        <td><p>One of the most misused and misty words in the world of dance. Three technically correct meanings are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>to denote the <strong>axis of rotation</strong> at any instant of a rigid body. This axis can be moving during the movement, and can be outside of the body. The two upper bodies of a tango couple can be considered as one body.</li>
            <li>to stress the straightness of a <strong>line</strong> connecting three or more points. This would make no sense at all for two points, since they are always on an axis. The term <strong>straight line</strong> is more appropriate here.</li>
            <li>a <strong>centerline</strong> in a body, meaning that there is some symmetry around this line. In dancing that would typically be the line that more or less is the centerline of your upper body and goes through your head. The term <strong>centerline</strong> is more appropriate here.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Many times the word axis is also abused to mean:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>a vertical line</li>
            <li>an erect posture</li>
            <li>balance</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The term “<strong>shared axis</strong>” is used to imply the couple is in static balance as a whole, but there is a (small) horizontal forward or backward force between partners, meaning they are leaning forward (<strong><span xml:lang="es" class="es" lang="es">apilado</span></strong>) or backward (A or V-shape of the lines between supporting foot and center of mass). The term <strong>shared balance</strong> would be more appropriate. </p>
          <p>The term “<strong>in axis</strong>” is used to imply an individual  is in own static balance. The term <strong>in own balance</strong> would be more appropriate. </p></td>

        <td>To be in <strong>static</strong> balance, the vertical line through your <strong>center of mass</strong> must cross the ground somewhere inside the outline of your support (being the rectangle around your feet or foot). Tango is <strong>dynamic</strong> however, and that will be part two in the learning process! Getting all timing right when doing the movements with the dynamic swaying forces in them is the real mastery you'll be looking for. Tango really becomes subtle while playing with energy this way.</td>

        <td><p>It is what a relaxed and free leg does when it encounters an obstacle (another leg) behind the knee whilst the leg was traveling *horizontally*. The knee will bend automatically, and the foot will go up in a circular motion, also automatically. It is used as a visual accent, and should be led in connection with the music. And it should be used very sparsely or not at all in crowded places!</p>
          <p>It is is not necessary for the follower to <strong>lift the foot</strong> herself. She could maybe add a little momentum if not enough energy was led. The upward motion should come out of horizontal energy. But it is absolutely horrible  to <strong>lift the knee</strong>, because the leg is supposed to go *backward*, and all of this automatically. The knee makes an essentially horizontal backward motion before being stopped. Remark: the only exception to this, is all the aerial legwork in modern tango, where all kind of static poses seem to be in fashion. I wouldn't call that a gancho however, which is rather supposed to be a very rhythmic accent.</p>
          <p>Don't change posture of the upper body. It is not because your leg goes backward that you should bend over, nor heighten your shoulders! </p>
          <p>The follower shouldn't be worried too much about “doing” anything, except for keeping the <a href="walking/walking.html">free leg</a> really free and relaxed, as always. The gancho should then happen automatically. If it doesn't happen, then it doesn't happen. It's best to gracefully continue. It's very hard to <a href="walking/leading-and-following.html">lead</a> it well. Leaders that insist that it still should happen after a lousy lead and while the musically interesting moment has passed already are not dancing tango but teaching nonsense. If well led, it will begin as a completely normal <a href="structure/steps-individually.html">backward step</a> where suddenly something will be behind your knee, and your horizontal body motion will be interrupted while being right on your standing leg.</p>
          <p>Leaders: the gancho is never led by the arms!! Try leading it without using your arms. It is all about remaining connected with the upper bodies. </p>
          <p>And most important of all: the lead is absolutely horizontal!!! Never pull  up with your arms. That would be as inelegant as can be.</p>
          <p>Conclusion: for a gancho,<strong> think backward, not up</strong>!</p></td>

Meanwhile often a<strong> front boleo</strong> is led. To lead the lean, the leader steps - as always in a very controlled fashion - away from the follower when her waist is high, so stepping for her is impossible. There is no pulling at her back!!! Keep the leaning as relaxed and as comfortable as possible, as when leaning against a wall.</p>
          <p>To lead and to accompany the boleo, the leader's body can make a circular motion - or rather triangular - by taking a step around the follower in between the step away and the step back. But more often, the triangle will be pointing backward, meaning the leader does only one step away, and then immediately does the returning step towards somewhere else than where he started.</p></td>

        <td><p>Tango music with two light beats evenly distributed in between the strong beats, as is normal in any <strong>waltz</strong>. The normal rhythmical structure of a song is to always split everything in 2. Time intervals get divided in 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and so on. That is the most natural thing to do. You don't headbang in a triangle. But with waltz you'd have to. :-)</p>
          <p>This means time gets divided in 3 instead somewhere in this series of divisions by 2. Is is fair to say on a slower and on a faster level, the music still is divided in 2 or 4 and so on. So we could have 4 phrases, of 4 bars each, that contain 3 beats each, that many instruments will even still divide in 2 to play quick notes. Take Metallica's “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urSYWcbWrkY">Nothing Else Matters</a>” as an example of this process.</p>
          <p>Such a tango waltz block of three typically lasts about one second.</p>
          <p>Tango waltz is especially apt for lots of turning: <span xml:lang="es" class="es" lang="es">giros</span> and sacadas. Non-fluid moves like <strong>sandwich</strong>, <strong>parada</strong> and <strong>gancho</strong> have no place in waltz.</p></td>

          <p>The playing or stepping of three notes each of the same duration in the place of two. It is  temporarily playing waltz in non-waltz music. It gives a stumbling feel to the music. It typically takes the time of one beat or of two beats. </p>
          <!--XXX<p>Example in &ldquo;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27HlY0umlmA">Milonga sentimental</a>&quot; sung by Carlos Gardel: when he starts singing: &ldquo;Milonga pa' recordarme, milonga sentimental&quot;, all syllables have the same duration except for &ldquo;-longa pa'&quot;. These three take up the same time as any other two. Indeed, the heaviest beats (the 1's) are &ldquo;Mi<strong>lon</strong>ga pa' recor<strong>dar</strong>me, milon<strong>ga</strong> sentimen<strong>tal</strong>&quot;, and the less heavy ones (the 2's) are &ldquo;Milonga pa' <strong>re</strong>cordarme, <strong>mi</strong>longa sen<strong>ti</strong>mental&quot;. All the other syllables fall on the lights in between the 1's and 2's, except for &ldquo;-ga&quot; and &ldquo;pa'&quot;, falling on 1,33 = 1+1/3 and 1,67 = 1+2/3 respectively. Simply said, he fits in three syllables in the timing of two. It adds elegance however if you know how to control yourself to spread these notes or steps evenly. To complicate matters, he uses a lot of very expressive <strong>phrasing</strong>, which simply means he deviates from this &ldquo;correct&quot; rhythm where he sees fit, all the while feeling it very well.</p>-->
        <p>It can also mean something closely related to this, but on a slower level: how to play three notes in one bar as evenly distributed as possible, but within the feel of a 4 or 2 beat bar. It amounts to distributing eight equal pieces of cake under three children really. Its is called the <a href="rhythm/milonga-rhythm.html#the332">3-3-2</a>.</p></td>
