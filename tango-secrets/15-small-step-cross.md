# Small Steps

## Steps Are Weight Shifts

In tango, a _**weight shift**_ (100% from one leg to the other) and a _**step**_ are the same thing.

It is very important that every complete weight shift from one leg to the other should be treated as a normal step (being **[fully led](leading-and-following.html)**!), even if it is of **very small** size.

## Small Steps

It is interesting that one cannot **shift weight** without horizontally moving his **center of mass**, because one can simply not step on the spot he is already standing on. That is, if we take the first foot of the ground only after putting down the second one, which we will always do in **tango**.

So even the most minimalist slow full weight shift will move your body for about 10 cm horizontally, since that is the width of your feet. Let's call this a **step in place**.

Small steps and large steps are both “legal” and actually equally important in tango. The length of the follower's step (as well as the direction and the moment) is to be [led](leading-and-following.html)!

## How to [Lead and Follow](leading-and-following.html) Small Steps, or any Step Length at All

See the [section on walking](walking.html).

## The Cross (el Cruce, la Cruzada)

An interesting and **elegant** example is the so called **_cross step_**, which really is such a full **weight shift** while your feet are together, but with the _outsides_ of your own feet facing or even touching each other.

The cross step does takes practice (even when doing it alone), and should be exercised in slow motion while remaining **in balance**. The hard part if you go from front to back leg is freeing up space for your back leg by lifting the heel (only) of your front leg, which allows you to get your **back knee behind you front knee**. You can even overtake your front foot with your back foot for about an entire foot length if you want. Mostly, it will be executed the other way round however (weight transfer from back leg to front leg), but executing it in balance does amount to more or less the same skill level and technique.

## The Cross Step in Couple

Again the follower is not supposed to execute this tiny cross step on her own or in a hurry. As any other step, it is **[to be led](leading-and-following.html "Leading")** on a specific moment, and whether slowly or fast really does matter. There is a school of thought that says follower should **cross automatically** when leader goes [outside to her right](../structure/walking-in-line.html "Walking Together in a Straight Line"). This is just **plain nonsense**, devised to bypass a deficiency in [leading and following](leading-and-following.html) skills. **Everything is [led and followed](leading-and-following.html) in tango**. It is very nice to be involved _together_ in the process of delicately putting the lady's foot in a cross and then slowly shifting her weight while remaining as together as possible.

## Three Crosses

Remark about the word “**cross**”: it is used on three completely different occasions. Firstly, the [**forward or backward cross step**](../structure/steps-individually.html "All Possible Individual Steps") as described before: a **small step** with insides of the feet on the outside. Secondly there is the [**crossed walking system**](../structure/walking-system.html "Walking System"), and thirdly the **[front or back cross step](../structure/steps-in-couple.html "Step Type: Cross")**, which is not about small steps, but about structure.
