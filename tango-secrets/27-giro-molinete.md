# The _Giro_ and the _Molinete_

## The _Giro_ (the Turn)

One partner doesn't step and pivots on one foot. The other partner steps around in a “**molinete**”. Even when the non-moving dancer starts to step as well, many people would still call this a part of a **giro** as long as the couple [turns](navigation-in-couple.html). A follower stepping around a (sometimes) moving leader could be compared to a moon orbiting a moving center. By remaining well in [connection](../walking/embrace-dissociation.html), the follower feels the influence on her stepping direction. She must be very aware of where the leader is. Once you are good enough to dance in **shared balance** (also called **shared axis**), you'll simply have to. But it is important to remember this when dancing in own balance.

## The _Molinete_ (the Little Windmill)

One partner stepping around the other. This could have been accomplished with all [sideways](steps-individually.html) **[chassé steps](../walking/collecting.html#chasse)**, but much more **elegant** and twice as fast is to curve a sideways **grapevine** around the partner in the center. The stepping pattern is [open, cross back, open, cross front](steps-in-couple.html), and then repeating. Typically, one can do one complete rotation in 4 steps, but it can be more or less, depending on **step length** and **distance to partner**. It can be reversed onto itself at any time (with a **rock step**, or after a [cross back or front](steps-in-couple.html) even with half an ocho, meaning a [cross front or a cross back](steps-in-couple.html) respectively). See also [**ocho cortado**](../glossary.html).

The **upper bodies** remain [facing at each other](../walking/embrace-dissociation.html) as always, and will thus be turning around in a slow and continuous fashion. The **lower body** of the **satellite** dancer however will pivot only in between steps and in a remarkable manner: in a straight grapevine it would pivot in between steps the following amounts: +90° +90° -90° -90° and repeating. In a curved grapevine that completes a turn in say 4 steps, we'll have to add 360°/4 = 90° every time! Or subtract when turning in the other direction. This yields pivots of +180° +180° 0° 0° and repeating.

### In Detail

**Clockwise** molinete: stepping around partner in 4 steps goes like this (when starting with weight on right foot and partner left in front of your feet, and thus an upper body dissociation of 45°):

-   [open step](steps-in-couple.html) [sideways](steps-individually.html) with left (upper body relative to lower body goes from facing front left to front right)
-   [collect feet](../walking/collecting.html) and **pivot half a turn** clockwise with lower body (while keeping absolute orientation of upper body, since partner doesn't move) (upper body relative to lower body goes from front right to back left, which is 135° of [dissociation](../walking/embrace-dissociation.html)!).
-   [back cross step](steps-in-couple.html) [backward](steps-individually.html) with right (clockwise around partner) (upper body relative to lower body from facing back left to front left)
-   [collect feet](../walking/collecting.html) and **don't pivot** lower body
-   again [open step](steps-in-couple.html) [sideways](steps-individually.html) with left (upper body relative to lower body goes from facing front left to front right)
-   [collect feet](../walking/collecting.html) and **don't pivot** lower body
-   [front cross step](steps-in-couple.html) [forward](steps-individually.html) with right (clockwise around partner) (upper body relative to lower body goes from facing front right to back right, which is again 135° of [dissociation](../walking/embrace-dissociation.html) in the opposite sense!)
-   [collect feet](../walking/collecting.html) and **pivot half a turn** clockwise with lower body (while keeping absolute orientation of upper body, since partner doesn't move)(upper body relative to lower body: from back right to front left).

and repeat.

This is intermediate technique for both **leader** and **follower** and should be practiced **in balance**, for instance around a chair or broomstick. A common mistake is to not [**dissociate**](../walking/embrace-dissociation.html) enough before the [**back cross step**](steps-in-couple.html), and as a result stepping away from the center, and pulling partner **off balance**.

### The Rhythm of the Molinete

#### The Molinete in Straight Rhythm

Of course the **slow version** of the molinete will always be perfectly legal: **one step per beat**. We could try it twice as fast, but often the music will be too fast for this. There is another faster option however, with fastness somewhere halfway in between.

**Pivoting** can always happen very quickly. This is possible because the feet are [collected](../walking/collecting.html), as always between any two steps. It does take a little time however, and for this reason it is possible to do the two non-pivoting steps even faster. Or more precisely: since **[collecting](../walking/collecting.html)** and **pivoting** happens right after the landing of the foot, it is the next step that can come faster if there's no pivot. This is precisely what we mean when we label a step **[quick](../rhythm/rhythm-language-quick-slow.html)** [or **slow**](../rhythm/rhythm-language-quick-slow.html): it's **[the time till the next step](../rhythm/rhythm-language-quick-slow.html)**.

So a natural rhythm for the molinete sequence above is **sloooooooow-[quick-quick-sloooooooow](../rhythm/rhythm-language-quick-slow.html)** and repeating.

bar bar bar bar bar bar (the bars)
123412341234123412341234 (the count)
b b b b b b b b b b b b (the heavy beats)
o b o f o b o f o b o f Molinete steps (open back open front) for the slow version
b o f o b o f o b o f o Molinete steps (open back open front) for the slow version
o bof o bof o bof o bof Molinete steps (open back open front) for the fast version
bof o bof o bof o bof o Molinete steps (open back open front) for the fast version

One of every two open steps will fall on a **light [beat](../rhythm/rhythm-basics.html)**. This means the entire molinete takes the duration of 3 [heavy beats](../rhythm/rhythm-basics.html), whereas there are only two heavy beats in a [bar](../rhythm/rhythm-basics.html) for non-[waltz](../rhythm/waltz-rhythm.html) music. This doesn't feel 100% logical, but it is not important at all to do one molinete per bar. Besides, you mostly won't even get to do two full consecutive **molinetes**, rather one and a half or much less.

#### The Molinete in Waltz Rhythm

There is an important difference for [**waltz rhythm**](../rhythm/waltz-rhythm.html), as bars are now divided in **three beats** instead of **four beats**. Or more generally, there are always two lights (instead of one) between the heavies now. The quick open step will have to be on one of the lights (the early one gives an **echoing** feel, the late one a **preparing** feel). Well, it doesn't have to really, but failing to do so is **clumsy** and **not very musical**. Only if the music is very fast, there simply might be no other option than doing it halfway the heavies, in between the two light [**waltz**](../rhythm/waltz-rhythm.html) beats.

barbarbarbarbarbar (the bars)

b..b..b..b..b..b.. (the heavy beats)
o..bo.f..o..bo.f.. Fast molinete steps (open back open front), **echoing** version (because it echoes the preceding strong beat)
o..b.of..o..b.of.. Fast molinete steps (open back open front), **preparing** version (because it prepares for the next strong beat)
o..b.of..o..bo.f.. Fast molinete steps (open back open front), a mixed version

It seems to me that the “**echoing** version” is much more popular than the “**preparing** version”, but I really suggest you try them both and **feel** the huge difference.

### Milonguero version

When dancing very close, the steps become so [small](../walking/small-steps-cross.html) that the pivots become less necessary. That is, you'd better only try this after mastery of the large step molinete, because dancing very [close](../walking/embrace-dissociation.html) is harder. See also [ocho milonguero](../glossary.html#OchoMilonguero).
