# In Between Steps: Collecting

In tango you **collect your feet** in between two consecutive steps. Always. Ankles together (or sometimes: outsides together, see [cross-step](small-steps-cross.html)). This happens in a relaxed way. It is a bit more correct to say you should always **collect your knees** in between steps, and as a result, the free foot will do the right thing if **muscles are relaxed** around there.

You don't step on the **free foot** after collecting, certainly not automatically. You **don't** even **put any weight on it** at all (yet). You just prepare for the next step. If you are **armed** for the next step (standing knee bent), the **free leg** can't wait to stretch in some direction (nothing at all changes in hips or upper body meanwhile!). Once this direction is clear, it will happen, but no stepping yet, just **projection**!

The main goal is to always reach an **island of perfect balance** in between steps, from where the next step can be negotiated on in all calmness.

## Foot Speed

This can be **very different from normal walking**, especially [**rhythmically**](../rhythm/rhythm-basics.html). When walking normally, once a free foot stops moving, you put it down, because its movement was calculated to arrive on the moment that **landing** was planned.

In tango, you **step on the beat**. So far so good. But then you normally immediately **collect**. This collecting process is not dictated by the **rhythm**! It is dictated by your arrival in **balance**. It often sort of happens **too early** rhythmically, and is very typical for tango. The collected free foot might have to wait before it can be put down again! You will “**arm**” yourself to **reach** with it, and it will only be put down (in accordance with the lead, and the lead with the rhythm of the music) after this reaching for the next step.

As a conclusion, tango might be about **smooth body movement**, but there certainly is not such a thing as _smooth free foot speed_ (as there is in **normal walking**). Quite the contrary!

Remark: this is more of a technical observation than something to focus on, certainly when stepping in a steady rhythm. But these **_consequences of rapidly collecting_** become more prominent when dancing more complicated rhythms. It simply means your **free foot might have to wait often while already having arrived**.

## Consecutive Steps

Because of this, there is confusion on **what exactly is a step**, or at least on when it **starts** and **ends**.

-   **Rhythmically**, you'll want to step on the beat, and you'd like steps to begin and end precisely there, on the moment when starting the weight shift on an already reached out leg, i.e. when **landing**.
-   **Structurally**, tango becomes much easier to understand if steps are separated at the moments when **collecting**.

These really are two very different ways of looking at the same thing.

## Step Length Confusion

Same thing here.

-   **Rhythmically**, it might seem logical to define step length as the distance one leg travels between **landing point**s of that same leg.
-   But we define steps as [weight shifts](small-steps-cross.html), and we always **collect our feet** immediately in between those weight shifts. When analyzing tango **structure**, **step length** will always be from the point were we collected - which is our **standing leg** - to were we will **land** with the **free leg**.

In both cases we have left and right **step lengths** alternating. But in the first case they both measure out your body traveling distance separately, while in the second case you'd have to add **step length**s together.

## An Example: the _Chassé Step_

A **chassé step** occurs when while walking normally, we suddenly don't **overtake** the **standing leg** with the **free one**, but instead land close to the standing leg, and then continue normally.

-   **Rhythmically** speaking, we could say that we interrupt normal step lengths left and right with **half a step left** and **half a step right**. If we maintain body speed throughout the process, indeed two of the [time intervals](../rhythm/rhythm-basics.html) between the **landing** of the feet will suddenly be **half as long** as before (see [traspié](../rhythm/traspie.html)).
-   But a tango dancer collects his feet very quickly, which makes it more logical to think **structurally**, and say that somewhere in between consecutive steps of normal size, he did one [very small step](small-steps-cross.html) (a weight shift in place).

It is actually the **same thing**.
