# The Sacada (Displacement)

## Definition

-   A very _bad definition_ would be: _kicking your partner's free leg away_. Although this kind of pushing against a free leg can be legally (albeit **gently**) done if you're very experienced, actually in a **sacada** your legs don't need to touch at all, and the energy source for this **flare** seemingly being the kicking or pushing is rather an **optical illusion**. The real energy source is the **turning of the upper body**.
-   The _standard definition_ is: the free foot of one dancer crosses the line between the feet of his/her partner. We'll prefer to call this an **entrada** however. The farther the line is crossed, the **deeper** the **entrada** is. This will always be a movement **[along](navigation-in-couple.html)**.
-   For a **sacada**, we'll use a slightly different but _very broad definition_: **any simultaneous step where one dancer ends up about where the other one was standing**. We'll say this dancer **does** the sacada, while his partner **receives** it, although they both step.

### A Special Case: [Stepping in Line](walking-in-line.html)

A problem with this definition is that “simply” stepping forward [in a straight line](walking-in-line.html) with your partner stepping backward would also be **sacadas**, while most people wouldn't be labeling it so. In a sense however, they are. There is a reason why this is much harder than stepping sideways together. If we consider [all stepping possibilities in couple](navigation-in-couple.html), it's on the limits of what still is a sacada. It becomes more of a normal sacada, if we change the **angle of “attack”**, the angle between the two steps. It can be 90°, or even tighter.

### The Trailing Foot

We will be conserving the amount of lean, [connection and distance between the two of you](../walking/embrace-dissociation.html), as usual. The dancer who does the sacada will need to step very close to where the now becoming [free leg](../walking/walking.html) of his partner was [standing](../walking/walking.html). The **sacada** is really on the limit between moving **[along](navigation-in-couple.html)** and **[opposite](navigation-in-couple.html)**, depending on whether this step is on the outside or the inside of this **trailing foot**.

And the not so important differences between **sacada** and **entrada** according to these definitions would be:

-   stepping close to the trailing foot on the outside (moving a little bit [**opposite**](navigation-in-couple.html)) is no **entrada**, but would still be a **sacada** (I'll call this a **pseudo-sacada**, makes sense because it feels the same);
-   stepping deeply between the legs of your partner is an **entrada** but would be less of a **sacada**.

This is not important tango-wisdom: it's just to keep the terminology on this site consistent.

## Execution

In all cases, the **sacada** requires perfect **balance** (as always).

Because of subtle **timing** issues, for the leader [leading](../walking/leading-and-following.html) his partner to “undergo” the sacada is really something else than [leading](../walking/leading-and-following.html) her to do the sacada with him!

Sacadas are hard to master. The center of the couple's rotation does not lie in between the couple, but offset to one side of the [embrace](../walking/embrace-dissociation.html)! The most common mistake is to focus on the legs instead of the [turning together around an offset point](navigation-in-couple.html). The **flare** of the “**displaced**” free leg is a result of the relative movement of the upper bodies and isn't even a goal, since it is dangerous in crowded places.

## 36 Different Sacadas

Let's suppose the **sacada** always happens towards the inside (inside means between the legs of the “**receiver**” here) of the **trailing foot** (for **pseudo-sacadas** on the outside, **[opens and crosses](steps-in-couple.html)** for the sacada “**doer**” as well as **[along](navigation-in-couple.html)** and **[opposite](navigation-in-couple.html)** get reversed, but really nothing else changes). Out of the [previous analysis](stepping-together-combinations.html), one can discern **36 structurally different sacadas**:

-   Leader moves to spot follower (leader does the sacada) versus other way round: 2 possibilities;

-   Leader can do [front cross, open step or back cross](steps-in-couple.html): 3 possibilities;

-   Follower can do [front cross, open step or back cross](steps-in-couple.html): 3 possibilities;

-   Leader [starts on left foot or on right foot](../walking/walking.html): 2 possibilities. After all previous choices have been made, this simply yields couples of mirror images of all these combinations. It is reasonable to consider these as structurally different though, since the embrace is asymmetrical, and therefore they'll feel quite different.


All these choices can be made completely independently of each other. That makes for 2x3x3x2 = **36 possibilities**. Why not try them all? Give it a go!

-   Can't the leader decide whether to go left or right (seen from his upper body)? [Not anymore](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74YLwinLT7M). Say he's on right and does an [open step](steps-in-couple.html), it'll have to be to the left of his torso, as described [before](steps-in-couple.html).

-   Whether the follower [starts on left or right](../walking/walking.html) determines whether our simultaneous step will be in [parallel system or in crossed system](walking-system.html). Oddly enough, this can't be chosen anymore after all the previous choices have been made. A sacada needs to be a movement where the couple rotates around a point somewhere in between them, though offset to one side. According to the [previous table](navigation-in-couple.html), the walking system can't be chosen anymore.


Aside from **inside/outside** and the **angle of “attack**”, there's nothing more to choose anymore to obtain a structurally different sacada, that is if we remain [connected with the upper bodies](../walking/embrace-dissociation.html).

There's a whole lot of other subtleties however that can be played with of course, not in the least the **[step length](../walking/walking.html)** , the **[distance](../walking/embrace-dissociation.html)** [in the **embrace**](../walking/embrace-dissociation.html) and the amount of **forward lean** (**apilado**).
