              <strong> Steve Andreas on Modelling with NLP : </strong><br>
              <br>
              <strong>A model has three levels: </strong><br>
              1. Epistemology, a set of methods for discovering and testing understandings. 
              <br>
              2. Methodology, a description of the understanding itself. <br>
              3. Technology, specific applications of the methodology to accomplish 
              a particular outcome in a particular context. <br>
              <br>
              &nbsp; <em>General/Specific </em><br>
              The more general a model is, the more it can be applied to a wide 
              range of situations.&nbsp; However, the more general it is, the 
              less information it supplies about specific situations.&nbsp; E=mc2 
              is understood to apply to the entire universe, but it doesn't tell 
              you how to make a match or how to build a pump.&nbsp; More limited 
              and specific models can provide more detailed information.&nbsp; 
              One important element is to know the scope of the domain described 
              by a model.&nbsp; For example, NLP is a wonderful model, but it 
              is not useful in designing an automobile engine. <br>
              <br>
              &nbsp; <em>Creation/Application </em><br>
              A new model is created when one realm of experience (e.g. "particle") 
              is used to describe another (e.g. electron) metaphorically, and 
              then further developed through testing, descriptions of how to apply 
              and refine this metaphor through mathematics, etc.&nbsp; The initial 
              creative leap is followed by a lot of work to develop the detailed 
              descriptions. <br>
              <br>
              <strong>A. How to Start </strong><br>
              <br>
              There isn't "a" way to model something.<br>
              A modelling process has been successful when you have a description 
              that enables you to: <br>
              &nbsp;1. Gain the skill, or transform the limitation modelled, and 
              <br>
              &nbsp;2. Teach someone else to gain the same benefits. <br>
              &nbsp;An even better test of your modelling is when you can teach 
              someone else your model and they can teach someone else to gain 
              the same benefits.&nbsp; <br>
              &nbsp;When you can do this, you have succeeded, and how you get 
              there is not important.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>B. What to Model </strong><br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;The first step is to define the skill, ability or limitation 
              that you want to model, and the context in which it occurs. <br>
              &nbsp;Chunking this down to a reasonable size is very important, 
              particularly when you have limited time.&nbsp; Even when you have 
              more time it is usually much more useful to chunk down to components, 
              model each one separately, and then integrate these components into 
              a larger model.&nbsp; One important distinction is between modelling 
              a process that is mostly internal, such as shame or feeling bad 
              about being criticized, in contrast to processes that are interactional, 
              such as negotiation.&nbsp; Negotiation is inherently more complex, 
              because you have two individual worlds and their interaction to 
              deal with.&nbsp; It can be useful to chunk down to a particular 
              kind of interaction, or even to one person's process/response to 
              the particular interaction.&nbsp; A precise model of a small process 
              is generally much more useful than an imprecise model of a larger 
              process -and you can build a precise model of a larger process by 
              modelling small pieces of it and then integrating them. <br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;There are many possibilities for how to choose a starting 
              point.<br>
              Following are a few of the possibilities that have been useful: 
              <br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> Think of a particular difficulty and its 
              resolution (for which there is not yet an NLP pattern).&nbsp; Usually 
              these will be nominalizations ("difficulty," "resolution"), and 
              your modelling task will be to denominalize it into the processing 
              that the person goes through.&nbsp; If you model a nominalized experience, 
              it will typically be at a sufficiently general level that your model 
              will be applicable to a wider range of people than if you model 
              a simpler and more specific skill.&nbsp; However, as the level of 
              generalization increases, so does the complexity of the process 
              you will need to model. <br>
              <br>
              &nbsp; You can model the problem and its resolution separately -or 
              alternately for contrast -and then model a process that will make 
              the transition from one to the other (more on this later).&nbsp; 
              This is how Connirae and I modelled the Criticism, Grief, Guilt, 
              Shame, and Forgiveness patterns. <br>
              <br>
              &nbsp; Remember that your model can only be as good as the experiences 
              that you choose to model.&nbsp; When modelling grief, for example, 
              we passed over people who said (often with a sigh, and shallow breathing) 
              that they now felt "OK" about the lost person.&nbsp; Instead we 
              chose people who felt (and behaved) joyously when thinking of the 
              lost person.&nbsp; If we had modelled the former, we would have 
              modelled a less-than-optimum solution.&nbsp; However, for practice 
              in learning how to model, modelling a less-than-supreme example 
              can be just as useful.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> Think of a particular skill that you, 
              or your clients, want, or need.&nbsp; Find a particularly good example 
              of someone who has that skill behaviorally, and model what they 
              do. <br>
              &nbsp; In selecting a model, be cautious about people's self-reports.&nbsp; 
              For example, some people say they are good at motivating themselves 
              because they are so aware of the half-hour process they use to get 
              out of bed!&nbsp; Others will say they are not good at motivating 
              themselves because they can't continue to motivate themselves at 
              the end of a highly-active 18-hour day!&nbsp; Find someone who exhibits 
              or can demonstrate to you the skill or quality that you want to 
              model.&nbsp; It may be difficult to find an exquisite model of a 
              particular skill in the limited context of the Summer Residential. 
              <br>
              <br>
              <strong>&nbsp;3.</strong> Explore the structure of anything.&nbsp; 
              This is how Connirae and I modelled how people represent time and 
              values, and how I modelled the structure of self-concept.&nbsp; 
              This is potentially much more generative, but it may also be more 
              complex, and the applications, uses and benefits are not usually 
              clear in advance.&nbsp; Think about problems or limitations for 
              which there are no dependable NLP patterns. <br>
              <br>
              <strong>&nbsp;4.</strong> Look and listen around you for someone 
              who is noticeably good at something or consistently exhibits a pleasant 
              or useful attitude and model that.&nbsp; This may be a particularly 
              useful option at the Summer Residential.&nbsp; Although consistent 
              attitudes typically generalize widely, they can be fairly simple 
              in structure/process.&nbsp; There are plenty of attitudes the world 
              could use more of (gratitude, appreciation, friendliness, tolerance, 
              love, respect, connection, equality) and plenty of attitudes the 
              world could use less of (scorn, hatred, meanness, superiority, inferiority, 
              coercion/manipulation, imposition, distance, grouchiness, etc.).&nbsp; 
              You can think of people in your life whose attitude you particularly 
              like or disliked, and model that. <br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;<strong>5.</strong> Notice the universal form to an individual 
              solution:&nbsp; When a client presents you with a difficulty and 
              you find a solution process that works for them, chunk up to a more 
              generalized form, and apply the solution to others.&nbsp; This is 
              how Connirae modelled a number of processes:&nbsp; Self-healing, 
              Core Transformation, Parental Timeline Reimprinting, Timeline Recoding 
              Process, and Naturally Slender Eating. <br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;<strong>6.</strong> Model a change that someone made spontaneously.&nbsp; 
              Find out the characteristics of before and after, and how the transition 
              was made.&nbsp; I have rediscovered the Swish Pattern, Content Reframing 
              and Change History a number of times doing this.&nbsp; If nothing 
              else, it's a wonderful way to gain experience and flex your modelling 
              muscles. <br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;<strong>7.</strong> Model a skill of your own that other people 
              have commented on, but you don't know clearly how you do.&nbsp; 
              Ask someone who doesn't have this skill, and wants it, to gather 
              information about it as their project.&nbsp; Since it is so natural 
              to you there will be many aspects that will be totally unconscious 
              and presupposed, and only someone else asking questions from a perspective 
              of not being able to do it will tease them out and make them obvious. 
              <br>
              <br>
              <strong>C. How to Proceed </strong><br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;<strong>1. </strong>Contrast <br>
              <br>
              &nbsp; Some kind of contrast will be extremely useful in helping 
              you zero in on the crucial distinctions operating.&nbsp; Whenever 
              possible make everything the same except the presence or absence 
              of what you are modelling. <br>
              &nbsp; a. You can compare the "same" person before and after they 
              made a change--whether spontaneous or deliberate. <br>
              &nbsp; b. You can compare two recent experiences in the same person 
              when they did or didn't have the skill or quality you are modelling. 
              <br>
              &nbsp; c. You can compare two people, one of whom has it and the 
              other doesn't. <br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> Selecting a counterexample. <br>
              <br>
              &nbsp; If you are modelling a problem state, for example, you don't 
              want to select any counterexample.&nbsp; You need a counterexample 
              that has all the features described for the problem state except 
              that the person's response is useful and life-affirming.&nbsp; This 
              will be an immense help in disregarding all the elements in the 
              two experiences that are the same, and irrelevant to success/failure. 
              <br>
              &nbsp; However, later you may need to go back and identify other 
              supporting elements that are necessary but not sufficient, and since 
              they were present in both experiences you disregarded them. <br>
              <br>
              <strong>&nbsp;3.</strong> Characterizing the Experience and its 
              counterexample <br>
              <br>
              &nbsp; What are the essential features of the states you are modeling?&nbsp; 
              What overall strategy sequence does the person go through?&nbsp; 
              Then chunk down to the smaller steps, and characterize them using 
              any and all NLP distinctions and methodologies you are familiar 
              with.&nbsp; As you go through the Residential you will be learning 
              more distinctions and methodology to apply.&nbsp; Among the ones 
              that are usually useful are: <br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; Rep. Systems <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; Strategies (sequence) <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T.O.T.E.&nbsp; (Test, Operate, Test, Exit), or 
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G.E.O.&nbsp; (Goal, Evidence, Operation) <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; Presuppositions/Beliefs <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; Submodalities <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; Meta-program Sorting <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; State/Physiology/Anchoring <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; "Parts" <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; Perceptual Position <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; Attentional Shifts:&nbsp; Self/Other Content/Context 
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; Motivation <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; Attitude <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; Criteria <br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;<strong>4. </strong>Content:&nbsp; Knowledge/Skills <br>
              <br>
              &nbsp; Most of the distinctions above are pure process differences 
              and do not contain specific content.&nbsp; However, most real-world 
              skills require knowledge of content.&nbsp; A geologist needs to 
              know about rocks, chemistry, physics, etc., and a negotiator may 
              need to know about corporate structure, contracts, interest rates, 
              time to develop a product, etc.&nbsp; These content-area skills 
              are essential for the good judgement required in carrying out the 
              process distinctions in your modelling.&nbsp; These are easily overlooked 
              in the focus on process, and need to be included as a part of your 
              modelling.&nbsp; For instance, an editor needs to know the letters 
              of the alphabet, and how to read and speak the language involved.&nbsp; 
              Even if it seems obvious, include required content areas in your 
              modelling description. <br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;<strong>5.</strong> Designing a Transition <br>
              <br>
              &nbsp; When you have characterized the differences between the problem 
              state and the desired state, this will usually suggest how to get 
              from the problem state to the desired state.&nbsp; How can you design 
              a sequence of changes to make the transition smooth, efficient, 
              and effective?&nbsp; A given set of changes may be very difficult 
              when made in one sequence, and very easy when done in a different 
              order.&nbsp; If there are a number of shifts to be made, decide 
              which will probably be easier or more comfortable to make first, 
              and then experiment to find out the best sequence of these shifts.&nbsp; 
              (It can be very helpful to model someone who went through this transition 
              successfully, and identify his/her sequence.) <br>
              &nbsp; At this point you should have an outline of a model of how 
              to achieve the desired outcome.&nbsp; It is probably missing some 
              distinctions and there will be certain contexts where it won't work, 
              but it will work in at least some cases. <br>
              <br>
              <strong>&nbsp;6. </strong>Testing and Refining Your Model <br>
              <br>
              &nbsp; Some refining can be done conceptually, but trying out the 
              model with yourself and others is the best way to learn how it can 
              be improved.&nbsp; By comparing additional examples with your model 
              outline you can discover additional useful features. <br>
              &nbsp; a. Congruency.&nbsp; Try out your model with yourself.&nbsp; 
              What problems could occur?&nbsp; How can you modify it so these 
              problems are excluded?&nbsp; Are all the positive functions of the 
              problem state preserved?&nbsp; For example, if someone feels comfortable 
              while public speaking by negatively hallucinating the audience, 
              this will interfere with a lively, connected presentation.&nbsp; 
              An alternative way of feeling comfortable will be more useful.&nbsp; 
              Are there any supporting elements or processes that you can add 
              that would make this process even more positive and beneficial to 
              the person? <br>
              &nbsp; b. Streamlining.&nbsp; The process you modeled from the counterexample 
              or exceptional model may have steps or aspects that are redundant 
              or superfluous.&nbsp; Is there anything you can leave out, yet still 
              get the desired results?&nbsp; Perhaps someone repeats a question 
              inside, and this only delays the response and is not necessary for 
              understanding it. <br>
              &nbsp; c. Amplifying.&nbsp; How can you add to the process to make 
              it more robust and enduring?&nbsp; This is best discovered by noticing 
              exactly where the process fails with specific clients, and what 
              you have to add to make it work.&nbsp; By building this into the 
              process you can extend the range of successful applications.&nbsp; 
              For instance, the phobia cure will not work well with some people 
              because of perceptual position misalignment.&nbsp; Adding this in 
              makes the phobia cure work successfully with a much wider range 
              of people.&nbsp; Sometimes the process can be amplified by changing 
              the sequence, or by speeding up the sequence. <br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; At this point it can be extremely useful to compare 
              your model of an exceptional skill with: <br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>1</strong>. Someone who is only moderately 
              skilled, to gain more understanding of the relative contribution 
              of individual components to the overall ability, and to highlight 
              aspects that may not have been obvious in your previous comparison. 
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>2.</strong> Someone else who is also exceptionally 
              skilled, to learn different ways to do a particular component of 
              a process, and/or to learn additional supporting elements that your 
              first model never learned -and that you can teach them to improve 
              their performance even more.&nbsp; (This potential improvement can 
              be a useful incentive to offer a highly-skilled person to get them 
              to participate in your modelling project.&nbsp; Another incentive 
              is that when you are successful, they will have an explicit model 
              that they can teach to clients or associates, to their benefit.)<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp; d. Special cases.&nbsp; Some clients will need more than 
              a small adjustment to deal with objections, concerns, problems, 
              or unique aspects.&nbsp; Often you can simply add a "standard" step 
              that checks for ecology or reframes common objections, so that the 
              model can be successfully applied to a wider range of clients without 
              further modification. <br>

              &nbsp; Concepts are derived from embodied experience. The close 
              embrace or Apilado in tango is a <em>musical embrace</em>. The encounter 
              in an<em> abrazo</em> is a living moment, less a rigid freeze posture. 
              The close embrace has an open side, between the bodies is a significant 
              angle. It is a diagonal position, a triangle. Inside that opening 
              grows the dance dialogue, on the embodied space between the dancers. 
              The dancers don't really melt together as in a slow, there is no 
              &quot;transcendence&quot; between the contradictions. When the potential 
              space is polluted, that is, dominated too strongly by one side, 
              there is no creativity, no play, no space for experience. As a dancer 
              makes a musical interpretation, the music can be too dominant, having 
              to much overstatements. For this, the narrative line must carry 
              the <em>minimum</em>, not the maximum is necessary for the effect. 
              To get a personal touch, there must be an internal rather than external 
              trigger for action. What does the music creates in me now? These 
              inside feelings and emotions are more instantaneous than simultaneous, 
              they are present or occurring at a specific instant, spontaneous 
              self-generated through an internal impulse, something like <em>being 
              drawn into the music</em> - which is not the same as movements intentionally 
              matched in time. <br>
              <BR>
              &nbsp; Musicality comes when you love the music and know it by heart. 
              A pianist says: &quot;There&#8217;s nothing quite like learning 
              to play a piece of music to really get inside it. Once I&#8217;m 
              inside it, once I&#8217;m feeling through the piece with my own 
              hands and working through its many parts with the microscope of 
              learning, once I really start to &#8220;get it&#8221; about the 
              music &#8230; it&#8217;s just staggering.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &nbsp; Playing piano is not the same as typing notes, an inner soul 
              has to touch the fingers. Touching another person is a form of physical 
              intimacy and plays an important role in dance. One can also be emotionally 
              touched, such as by music. In this metaphorical sense it refers 
              to some action or object that evokes a sad or joyful emotion. Hearing 
              music is more than listening, it is touching all of the senses simultaneously. 
              In singing, the body's pulsations are protruded on to a stream of 
              breath, thus revealing the singers emotions and offering a target 
              for affective identification for the listeners. Even when listening 
              to sounds of musical instruments, a part of the listening experience 
              is a notion of the bodily activities that produce the sounds. A 
              player's sense of a musical style is primarily felt in contact with 
              the instrument, and can not be acquired through discourse. The physical 
              effort to create sound is already part of the music. The bandone&oacute;n, 
              originally ment as a small church organ, needs the musician's whole 
              body to express a boundary-transcending sound. A musician is expressing 
              himself through his instrument and connecting awareness to the whole 
              body. He is not unpacking a digital audio format. Dancing on life 
              music feels much different from a mp3 audio file which encodes music 
              into a technological form. We interact through all our senses, the 
              sensing body in movement has much more layers than its visual image. 
              <br>
              
              <br>
              &nbsp; Music and the dancers make a triangle. It is as if the music 
              comes into the opening of the close embrace. The gestures arise 
              naturally from the music and their soul. It is making itself up 
              as it goes along, it is <em>organic. &nbsp; Carlos Gavito:</em> 
              &quot;The secret of tango is in this moment of improvisation that 
              happens between step and step. It is to make the impossible thing 
              possible: to dance <strong>silence</strong>. This is essential to 
              learn in tangodance, the real dance, that of the silence, of following 
              the melody.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &nbsp; Social dancing before 1900 involved mainly dances with prescribed, 
              restrained steps. Western males appear to have been released from 
              this straight-jacket to do creative social dance choreography by 
              Vernon Castle in 1911. <br>
              Vernon Castle's method of dividing ballroom dances into &quot;<strong>figures</strong>&quot; 
              may be viewed as the construction of a set of symbols. The mapping 
              of these onto numerical digits is exemplified using figures from 
              the <strong>Argentine Tango</strong>.<br>
              Castle's change from sequence dancing to ballroom dancing can then 
              be viewed as a change from rational dancing (like rational numbers 
              that have recurring groups) to<strong> irrational or creative dancing 
              </strong>(like irrational numbers having sequences with no repetition). 
              Creative dance also promotes personal explorations in the control 
              of the body and its relationship to space and time and to other 
              individuals. It gives a form of controlled non-verbal expression 
              of emotion, a release of tension, and an opportunity to create (Farley, 
              1969, 88). <br>
              The milonga has been used as an example of Irrational Dancing. It 
              is a very soft private dance, with visual emphasis on the leg movements. 
              This character was changed dramatically in Paris in the 1930's, 
              where the dance was combined with the proud torso of the other ballroom 
              dances, and given a staccato action. This moved the visual emphasis 
              to the<strong> torso and head</strong>. <br>

              The standard ballroom dances have diverse origins. rhythms, tempos, 
              and aesthetics, but have one thing in common: they are all danced 
              by a <strong>couple</strong> (usually a man and a lady) in '<strong>Closed 
              Hold</strong>', in milonguero style changed into a close embrace, 
              giving a wonderful connection with your partner and the music during 
              an exclusive moment.<br>
              In this hold, the lady's upper arms are both held horizontal by 
              a suitable placement of the man's arms and hands. This not only 
              makes it comfortable for the lady to follow the man's lead, but 
              also gives the couple a deportment of regal appearance. This deportment 
              is a characteristic of dances coming from Western Europe, and is 
              a heritage of the origin of ballroom dancing in the <strong>royal 
              </strong>courts of Europe. The erect and fixed torso is even more 
              evident in Classical Ballet, which had the same origins.<br>

              The peculiar ballroom dancing &quot;Closed Hold&quot; possibly had 
              its origins in the time when men wore swords while dancing. As most 
              men are right handed, it was conventional to wear the sword and 
              scabbard on the left-hand side of the belt, so as to facilitate 
              the drawing of the sword with the right hand. Thus if a man was 
              to put his arm around a lady's back, she would have to be on his 
              right, or she would keep tripping over the sword. Thus he could 
              only put his right arm around her; and if she was receptive to this 
              advance, she would place her left arm over the man's right. From 
              here it is a simple matter for the man to offer his left hand for 
              the lady to hold for additional balance while dancing.<br>
              The word '<strong>ballroom</strong>' denotes a room where balls 
              may be held: that is: formal social dances. Balls were important 
              social events in the days before radio and television (as in 'having 
              a ball'). The word 'ball' derives from the Latin 'balare' meaning 
              'to dance'. This is also the origin of the related words : ballet, 
              ballerina, ballad. Ballroom dance is a style of partner dance which 
              originated in the western world. Its performance and entertainment 
              aspects are also widely enjoyed on stage, in film and on television. 
              Choreography or dance composition, is the art of making structures 
              in which movement occurs. <br>

              Ballroom dancers will tend to put appearance above connection, while 
              club dancers will tend to focus primarily on their partners. <strong>Nightclub 
              and street dances </strong>tend to focus on connection between partners 
              and musicality, ballroom dances tend to focus more on performing 
              to an audience. Of course, ballroom dancers do learn about connection 
              and musicality, and club dancers are often excellent performers. 
              <br>
              Competetive ballroom dance consists of some number of couples each 
              performing for the audience's attention, and as most of the audience 
              are themselves dancers, everyone gets a chance to try to outperform 
              their peers. <br>
              There is also a growing interest in formation dance, which is also 
              performance-oriented. Formation ballroom dance involves anywhere 
              from two to dozens of couples performing a choreographed ballroom 
              dance routine. <br>

              Dans la danse on travaille sur les qualit&eacute;s du geste, ce 
              que LABAN a appel&eacute; &quot;valeurs expressives du mouvement&quot;. 
              Ce qui est remarquable, c'est que la mati&egrave;re m&ecirc;me du

              un soi qui est soi-m&ecirc;me tout en &eacute;tant ouvert &agrave; 
              autre chose. <br>
              L'espace-temps de la danse est aussi un moment social. Les outils 
              premiers de la <strong>communication </strong>sont en effet mobilis&eacute;s: 
              sensorialit&eacute;, flux toniques et posturaux. Chaque situation 
              renvoie &agrave; des types de relation bien sp&eacute;cifique, qui 
              sont au demeurant lisibles dans les danse traditionnelles. <br>
              La<strong> relation</strong> singuli&egrave;re, entre deux personnes 
              notamment est &eacute;galement lieu d'<strong>exploration</strong>. 
              Elle s'investit sur divers modes : dans un travail de proximit&eacute; 
              comme c'est le cas dans les propositions issues de la danse-contact, 
              ou dans une mise &agrave; distance comme dans de nombreuses improvisations.<br>
              Dans le corps-&agrave;-corps de la danse-contact, chacun est tour 
              &agrave; tour port&eacute;, support, et le centre de gravit&eacute; 
              du groupe dansant est en dehors du sujet, &quot;entre deux&quot;. 
              Nous y voyons surgir de v&eacute;ritables matrices relationnelles 
              qui renvoient &agrave; une relation affective : envelopper puis 
              repousser par exemple.<br>
              Les<strong> improvisations</strong> o&ugrave; intervient l'&eacute;coute 
              permettent d'int&eacute;grer l'autre dans un fonctionnement, de 
              trouver un accord et de construire une relation &agrave; partir 
              d'un syst&egrave;me non-verbal. Il ne s'agit pas de signaux &agrave; 
              &eacute;mettre ou &agrave; capter, mais d'une empathie &agrave; 
              d&eacute;velopper. <br>
              Il existe d'autres approches. Certaines sont le fait d'individus 
              &eacute;clair&eacute;s qui nomment leur synth&egrave;se personnelle, 
              d'autres sont de v&eacute;ritables mouvements institu&eacute;s. 
              <br>
              Le<strong> Body Mind Centering </strong>cr&eacute;&eacute; par Bonnie 
              Bainbridge Cohen en est un exemple tr&egrave;s int&eacute;ressant, 
              qui se centre sur une approche sensorielle int&eacute;gr&eacute;e 
              par le mouvement, et dans lequel la danse-contact joue un r&ocirc;le 
              tr&egrave;s important.<br>
              On pourrait &eacute;galement citer la<strong> biodanse</strong> 
              et bien d'autres qui surgissent r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement et dont 
              il est parfois difficile de pr&eacute;ciser les ancrages et les 
              pratiques sp&eacute;cifiques . Les approches orientales sont souvent 
              mentionn&eacute;es avec des raccourcis parfois surprenants. Il faut 
              mentionner l'<strong>eurythmie</strong>, qui s'inscrit dans l'approche 
              anthroposophique cr&eacute;&eacute;e par <strong>Rudolf Steiner</strong> 
              au d&eacute;but du si&egrave;cle. <br>
              Dans une s&eacute;rie de conf&eacute;rences celui-ci en expose les 
              fondements : A partir de la vision goeth&eacute;enne de l'art comme 
              d&eacute;voilement des lois naturelles, il s'agit de mettre les 
              participants en communication avec leur nature propre, en communion 
              avec la nature cosmique. L'eurythmie comprend entre autres un syst&egrave;me 
              de gestes articul&eacute;s au langage. La rime, le rythme, tout 
              ce qui &eacute;l&egrave;ve la parole au rang plus noble de po&eacute;sie, 
              sont traduits ici par des mouvements d'ensemble . L'eurythmie curative 
              est int&eacute;gr&eacute;e au programme de nombreuses institutions 
              en Allemagne et en Suisse.<br>
