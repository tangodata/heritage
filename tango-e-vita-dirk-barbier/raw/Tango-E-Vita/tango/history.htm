          &nbsp; &nbsp; They say, the term <strong>nostalgia</strong> describes 
          a longing for the past, often in idealized form. The word is made up 
          of two Greek roots (&quot;returning home&quot;, and &quot;pain&quot;), 
          to refer to the pain a grieving person feels because he wishes to return 
          to his native home, and fears never to see it again. They say, it is 
          about &quot;The Way We Were&quot;... which is a reflection on the present.<br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; It implies a &quot;sad thought&quot;, a greater pain..., 
          the recognition that <em>here and now</em>... &quot;this is not who 
          we are&quot;. <br>

          &nbsp; &nbsp; In a relatively short time, the Buenosairean society was 
          diversified and became more complex. As Buenos Aires began to expand 
          with "los barrios" or districts and the urban changes turned the city 
          into a metropolis with a starting consumer culture, new career paths 
          made it possible to move up. Everything began moving towards a new &quot;Order 
          of Things&quot;. Those who didn't fit in, were socially disoriented 
          and bound to disappear like <a href="http://www.worldpress.org/photo_essays/cartoneros/" title="Photos by Andrea di Martino: The Ghost Train of the Cartoneros" target="_blank">ghosts</a>. 
          So began a new era, like the process of globalization the end of the 
          twentieth century. <BR>

          <BR>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; New habits... Between end of the first decade of the 20'th 
          century and the 1940's, people of the districts began to frequent "los 
          cafés" or coffee houses and cabarets in the buenosaires center, and 
          politicians looking for votes walked the districts making political 
          campaigns. The extension of free time outside the family homeworld, 
          offered to many <em>new encounters</em> with great opportunities. <BR>
          <BR>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; A <em>new consuming public</em> was profiling or stereotyping 
          itself, middle class &quot;town-dwellers&quot;, common people, of the 
          districts, that listened to tangos and danced, read newspapers, magazines 
          and went to the cinema, frequented new socialization fields, from the 
          local club to the bar and the "society of social climbing", trying to 
          join a higher social class by becoming friends with people from that 
          class, or, for the most part, just to meet other men and talk about 
          literature, theatre and politics. Women however, didn't supposed to 
          be there unless the &quot;caf&eacute;&quot; had a separate entrance 
          and &quot;las damas&quot; stayed in the family sector. Later, &quot;los 
          caf&eacute;s&quot; transformed to elegant &quot;confiter&iacute;as&quot; 
          where ladies and se&ntilde;oritas could meet to drink tea at five. <a href="http://www.solesdigital.com.ar/turismo/cafes_de_bsas.htm" title="Caminando las esquinas porteñas_tranvía del olvido" target="_blank">

          &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Consumerism and mobility.</em> During the second half 
          of the 19th century, animal-pulled trams or buses were the only transport 
          means known. Therefore, there was an important need to create a <em>fast 
          transport system</em> capable of carrying passengers between the center 
          of the city and the suburbs. As in only ten years, between 1903 and 
          1913, the number of inhabitants almost dubbeld, the construction of 
          fast <em>subway</em> (subte / subterr&aacute;neos) became the right 
          solution to the astonishing growth of the city. The construction and 
          operation of Line &quot;A&quot; took 26 months. Newspapers commented 
          in great detail on the ongoing of the construction work and its opening 
          on<em> December 1st, 1913</em>, the first stage which reached Plaza 
          Miserere. The following day the subway was opened to the people, and 
          170.000 passengers traveled by this new transport means.<BR>
          <BR>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; The expansion of the transport network facilitated an 
          endless number of interchanges between the world of the districts and 
          the one of the center. Buenos Aires had not only grown but was also 
          <em>more communicated</em>. The mainstreet in the heart of the city, 
          "La calle Corrientes", became the "neutral territory" on which the culture 
          of the center and the one of the districts "were to taste". <br>
          <br>
          <a href="http://users.telenet.be/Tango-E-Vita/tango/fashion.htm" target="_blank"><img src="http://users.telenet.be/Tango-E-Vita/tango/ElTango_FACIO_HÉBEQUER_Guil.jpg" alt="Sexyness is such a hot item during this decade_sexy" width="398" height="450" border="0"></a> 
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Like in Paris, cabarets, nightclubs were opened and flourished, 
          and tango gradually advanced from the obscurity of the bordellos to 
          the multicolor lights of city night life. With the opening of cabarets 
          <em>the image of tango changed</em>. They rapidly multiplied and they 
          had French Belle Epoque names. The cabaret became big business, it was 
          a place of entertainment, to socialize and even a studio for personal 
          business or a political privé rendez-vous. The music titles became melancholic, 
          nostalgic or romantic without sexual connotations. Women started to 
          sing these more decent tangolyrics without shameful feelings and in 
          the 1920's, they displayed their singing talents first dressed and smoking 
          like the men. In 1930 &quot;Adi&oacute;s Argentina&quot;, with tango-star 
          actress Libertad Lamarque, became the first Argentine film to have a 
          soundtrack.<br>
          <BR>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Entering the decade of the &quot;Roaring Twenties&quot;, 
          we find a new generation of female artists, who became a raging success 
          on the stages of commercial theaters, the cabaret scene and the radio 
          and movie industries. The formation of modern Argentina was promoted 
          by an active interaction between <em>the culture industry </em>and its 
          audiences / consumers. This exchange reflected the need in the public 
          sphere for the creation of a modern feminine identity, <em>a new profile 
          model</em>. These female figures occupy the setting during the decades 
          of the 20 and of the 30, taking advantage of the radio diffusion, the 
          improvement of the record system and the rise of the spoken movies, 
          which would permit greater diffusion of popular music. It was an early 
          manifestation of what later on would be part of the &quot;sexual revolution&quot; 
          or &quot;female liberation movement&quot;. <BR>
          <BR>
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herminie_Cadolle" target="_blank" title="Herminie_Cadolle_1845-1926_inventor_modern_bra_Cadolle_lingerie_house_BsAs"><img src="http://users.telenet.be/Tango-E-Vita/tango/Hermine_Cadolle.jpg" width="437" height="255" border="0"></a> 
          <BR>
          <BR>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; As the male / female population balance was getting more 
          equal in Buenos Aires, dating became more normal and the scene changed. 
          Now, both men and women went to crowded tango dancehalls and confiterías, 
          where they danced very close, the woman’s head over her partner’s right 
          shoulder, so he could whisper in her ear and visa versa, this "cheek 
          to cheek-style" was called apilado, piled up, packed tightly together. 
          Later, with the appearance of the tango in the milonga danceclubs and 
          the salón in the family houses, the tanguero public transformed. From 
          1940, <em>the tango language</em> had to express something else than 
          the eroticism of the bordelles and cabarets louche. <em>Consciousness 
          shifts</em> need new profiles. The aesthetic focus was no longer on 
          sexual desire and carnal pleasures but on the elegant appearance which 
          can be called an illusory deception, false premises or over-mystification 
          of the feminine with tangos like “María”, “Malena”, “Gricel”, “Ninguna”, 
          “Naranjo en flor”. <BR>

          <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; The world seems destined to lose half its cultural heritage 
          within the next century - Why do languages disappear and what is the 
          significance of this loss, both to those who speak the languages and 
          the rest of us? <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Janus Billeskov Jansen</em> and <em>Signe Byrge S&oslash;rensen</em> 
          co-directed &quot;In Languages We Live&quot; and &quot;The Importance 
          of Being &#8211; MLABRI&quot; as part of the <a href="http://www.dfi.dk/tidsskriftetfilm/60/voices.htm" title="Danish Film Institute Det Danske Filminstitut" target="_blank">&quot;Voices 
          of the World&quot; project: Language is the House of Being.</a> The 
          two Danish filmmakers wrote down a set of ethical rules for &quot;Voices 
          of the World&quot;. One rule goes: &quot;Since all oppression presupposes 
          dehumanisation of the Other, &quot;Voices of the World&quot; aims to 
          counteract the mutual demonising of cultures, and to achieve this by 
          means of humanising the unfamiliar and the different.&quot; <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Billeskov Jansen: &quot;It's important to mention that 
          this isn't about <strong>nostalgia</strong>, it's all about knowing 
          your past and preserving your language and, in turn, your identity &#8211; 
          having respect for your own language and an awareness that all languages 
          are unique and worth protecting and being proud of.&quot; <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Byrge S&oslash;rensen: &quot;People stop speaking their 
          language, because they have no choice! If they see that their children 
          don't stand a chance because they don't speak the main language in the 
          area where they live, they have no motivation for passing their mother 
          tongue on to the next generation&quot;.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; David Crystal, a linguistics professor: &quot;We need 
          to draw attention to the values of multilingualism as a universal human 
          good, and as a personal opportunity to become culturally mature. <em>A 
          language acts in a sense as a straightjacket, allowing you to think 
          in one way only.</em> Then, - unless you have exposure to other languages 
          and therefore other experiences and other visions -, that is not a very 
          healthy situation.&quot; <br>

          <strong> <font size="5" color=#663366>The disappearance of &quot;El Tango&quot;</font></strong> 
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Tango, born in the the slums of Buenos Aires. The bandoneonist 
          and Argentine composer Rodolfo Mederos: <em>The tango does not come 
          from Argentina, but from a Babylon Tower </em>(by the war-immigrations 
          of Jews, Italian, Polish, Spanish and other); it arises from that Tower 
          of Babel of those immigrants that did their music but fertilized by 
          the Neapolitan canzoneta, the &quot;couple espa&ntilde;ol&quot;, the 
          Polish polka with some &quot;criollismo regional&quot; and minted in 
          an immense sadness, because many immigrants knew that they never would 
          return to their land, not only because they were in war, but because 
          they did not have the sufficient wealth or income. <br>
          <BR>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; The tango, as musical entity, contains three musical influences 
          and they have roots in Europe: <em>the baroque</em> one, by its ornamentation; 
          <em>the neoclassicism</em>, by its structure and harmony, and <em>the 
          romanticism</em>, in its interpretive aspect. In the beginning, the 
          tango was melodious and spoke of &quot;What is happening&quot; to the 
          people, they sung their own histories and later they could dance that 
          music; the modern tango was removed of that in a very toxic way and 
          put its eyes in concert halls. <br>
          <BR>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Our culture is in crisis, in state of disappearance; 
          the tango to which I refer has disappeared.</em> In their long presentation, 
          where Rodolfo Mederos recalled the military dictatorship of their country 
          and that produced 30 thousand disappeared persons, &quot;and also disappeared 
          a culture&quot;, referred to the Argentine cultural movement currently 
          and to the role that develops the tango in it, what defined as a <em>shopping</em> 
          where the tango is &quot;macdonalizado&quot;, merchandized, they put 
          in things that have nothing to do with the history of the tango, such 
          as cosmetics, and the people, above all the tourism, consume this thinking 
          that is a form of the tango; in reality the tango does not exist as 
          popular culture, it exists as product for the tourism, that is to say, 
          the tango has died. It has become a product for the tourism. <br>

          &nbsp; &nbsp; Buenos Aires is viewed as one of the most progressive 
          cities in South America. The city is in the midst of a tourism boom 
          since the Argentine peso lost two-thirds of its value shortly after 
          the country's 2001 economic collapse. Four of each ten tourists mention 
          the tango as reason to travel to Buenos Aires. During tango festivals 
          and competition contests, the hotel sector, the traditional articles 
          such as souvenirs, tango discs, books and videos, beneficiaries with 
          the presence of the foreign tourists. It generates dividends in the 
          gastronomy, fashion and transport. Tangomusic moves around the world 
          about 3,000 million dollars, of that single total 1% (30 million) correspond 
          to Argentina. The invasion of foreign tangueros changes the old milonga 
          codes. The codes changed to please them, drain the dancefloor to put 
          more tables. The idea that they have is to put much people and it does 
          not concern the quality of the dance space. A tourist bubble?<br>

          <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Palais de Glace, the circular building where tango was 
          introduced into the high society ballrooms, leaving behind the slums 
          and the brothels. Palermo was a neighborhood of <em>guapos</em>, inhabited 
          by marginal people, <em>malevos</em> (small-time hoods), <em>compadritos</em> 
          (street ruffians), <em>cuchilleros</em> (knifefighters) and prostitutes. 
          This is immortalized in many stories by the Argentine writer Jorge Luis 
          Borges, who in his &#8220;milongas&#8221; depicts the &#8220;taitas&#8221; 
          (daddy) and &#8220;guapos&#8221; (cocky, good-looking guy) who lived 
          in the area. It was also a refuge for tango because in certain times 
          to dance it was considered a sin. Nevertheless, places such as &#8220;Lo 
          de Hansen&#8221; and &#8220;Les Ambassadeurs&#8221; that were crowns 
          of the tango, with one for the working classes and the other for the 
          upper classes, were in Palermo. In the XIX century &quot;El restaurant 
          del parque de Tres de Febrero&quot; known as &quot;lo de Hansen&quot;, 
          was one of the first tango places where the high class society used 
          to hide while they learnt this dance, which was not appropiate at the 
          time. &quot;El Vel&oacute;dromo&quot; was another Palermo local, and 
          &quot;Armenonville&quot; (on the corner of Figueroa Alcorta Avenue and 
          Salgero Street) that no longer exist. <br>

          <strong>Alertas de tango:</strong> Arque&oacute;logos de la ciudad de 
          Buenos Aires encontraron el piso de ladrillos del <strong>Caf&eacute; 
          de Hansen</strong> 50 cent&iacute;metros bajo tierra en el barrio de 
          Palermo, en el norte de la ciudad. El caf&eacute; tom&oacute; su nombre 
          del apellido de su primer due&ntilde;o, Juan Hansen, quien lo inaugur&oacute; 
          en 1877 en un caser&oacute;n que se alzaba en medio del actual parque 
          de Palermo y los historiadores se&ntilde;alaron que en aquella &eacute;poca 
          era frecuentado por gente adinerada. Hasen era un local muy iluminado 
          en contraposici&oacute;n con el Tambito, pero a medianoche el distinguido 
          p&uacute;blico del restaurant era reemplazado por compadritos y bacanes 
          y los m&uacute;sicos europeos de m&uacute;sica selecta por los tangueros 
          criollos. Hansen fue lugar de tertulia para las patotas de la aristocracia 
          porte&ntilde;a de principios de siglo y no se trat&oacute; de un sitio 
          para bailar sino para escuchar tangos. Pese a su popularidad, el Caf&eacute; 
          Hansen fue demolido por las autoridades de entonces, buscando ampliar 
          los accesos hacia el vel&oacute;dromo de la ciudad. Era un ambiente 
          bravo, pero muy divertido&quot;, escribi&oacute; el fallecido compositor 
          Enrique Cad&iacute;camo sobre el lugar, demolido en 1912 para dar paso 
          a calles y otras obras viales. A partir de 1890 llegaron las orquestas 
          de tango al Caf&eacute; de Hansen, que se hizo tan popular que es nombrado 
          en tangos como &quot;Tiempos Viejos&quot;, que evoca la historia de 
          la &quot;rubia Mireya&quot;, una bella mujer que lo frecuentaba, seg&uacute;n 
          la tradici&oacute;n &quot;tanguera&quot;. No se sabe si existi&oacute; 
          Mireya, pero s&iacute; es seguro que encarnaba a las mujeres que iban 
          al Hansen a conocer hombres, muy bien vestidas y con buenas joyas. Era 
          un sal&oacute;n de baile, concurrido por gente calavera (de la noche) 
          de diferentes rangos. Tuvo importancia porque, adem&aacute;s de restaurante, 
          funcion&oacute; como lugar de baile -cuenta Gabriel Soria, vicepresidente 
          de la Academia Nacional del Tango-. Y all&iacute; se bailaba un tango 
          muy bien bailado porque, en sus inicios, era un lugar elegante. En la 
          d&eacute;cada de 1910, en el Hansen tocaron orquestas t&iacute;picas, 
          como las de Roberto Firpo y Francisco Canaro. Ellos en una entrevista 
          recuerdan que sol&iacute;an armarse peleas entre los muchachos bien 
          (de clase alta). Es que al Hansen iban los chicos ricos a &quot;tirar 
          manteca al techo&quot;. &quot;Iban a buscar chicas y todo terminaba 
          en peleas, a veces con tiros y sillas volando por el aire&quot;. El 
          investigador Oscar del Priore dice que en el Hansen se bailaba ocasionalmente. 
          &quot;Es importante para el tango porque fue uno de los lugares m&aacute;s 
          famosos donde se tocaba el g&eacute;nero. De tarde funcionaba como una 
          confiter&iacute;a inofensiva. Pero a la noche, era m&aacute;s denso, 
          porque iban las patotas y los tangueros&quot;.</em>) --<br>

          restaurant is a real photographic museum which portrays well known local

          &nbsp; &nbsp; The Buenos Aires' hygienist politics grew most intensely 
          since the end of the 19th Century. The chronic epidemies that happened 
          woke up the necessity of carrying out works for public hygiene and health. 
          The downtown squares were reshaped and began to perform functions of 
          education (in a way of interacting where the popular classes could acquire 
          manners of the higher one), of sociability and hygienics. The idea of 
          regularity, of a geometrically uniform and homogenous space—often thought 
          of as a guarantee of or synonym for social order—was the cornerstone 
          on which this pampean metropolis was built. <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Being Argentina a country of immigrants, several societies 
          were created to take care of their compatriots with economic, social 
          and health lacks. The creation and developement of public cemeteries 
          ended the burials in churches, and this fact was added to the secularization 
          politics of those times that becomes specially apparent in the civil 
          issues. Formerly the dead were buried in the courtyards of the churchs 
          except the poor <em>or </em>black people that were thrown in the open 
          country to be eaten by the wild dogs.<br>

          &nbsp; &nbsp; The Birth of the Clinic, the clinic had no origins, but 
          simply and suddenly arrived. The works for public health and the intense 
          building of hospitals would be the way to put in practice the hygienist 
          politics, whose influence grew most intensely since the end of the 19th 
          Century. On the other hand, the Hospitals of Communities will denote 
          the process of an immigratory wave that made this City the cosmopolitan 
          par excellence. A characteristic that still remains, with cultural dialogue 
          between the diversity of its population, avoiding the constitution of 
          ghettos. The creation and developement of public cemeteries ended the 
          burials in churches, and this fact was added to the secularization politics 
          of those times that becomes specially apparent in the civil issues. 
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Another signal of this politics of past icons substitution 
          was the consecutive demolitions for openings and enlargings of streets 
          and avenues. Squares and parks were in those times real landmarks of 
          the attempt to urbanize and to complete the new limits of the City, 
          consolidated in 1887 with the annexion of the towns of Flores and Belgrano. 
          The downtown squares were also reshaped and began to perform functions 
          of education (in a way of interacting where the popular classes could 
          acquire manners of the higher one), of sociability and hygienics. <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; --(<em> Para el habitante de Buenos Aires Corrientes es, 
          desde pibe (ni&ntilde;o o joven), un faro de la cultura y el entretenimiento,

          de todos los pa&iacute;ses y &eacute;pocas, y debatir luego sobre lo

          &nbsp; &nbsp; The squares were the best places for the poor to go out 
          of their precarious housings, and especially for men, instead of the 
          dangerous inns and coffee bars where they went to enjoy themselves. 
          This philosophy promoted by the State would contribute to consolidate 
          itself through social control norms. <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; -- ( <em>El mapa marca un momento clave de configuraci&oacute;n

          &nbsp; &nbsp; At the end of the 19th Century there were no more than 
          twenty green spaces, but in the beginning of the 20th were projected 
          and built most of the current parks of the City, being the centre of 
          the urbanization in those times. Hospitals were founded formerly for 
          giving home to resourceless people. As a consequence of the poor medical 
          knowledge of that time, they were used also to segregate and isolate 
          certain kinds of patients. Towards 1880, the hygienist current begins 
          to think about human health as a right that must be assured by the State. 
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; The chronic epidemies that happened in Buenos Aires woke 
          up the necessity of carrying out works for public hygiene and health. 
          It&#8217;s therefore common to see several hospitals in the postcards 
          of 100 years ago. San Roque Hospital was inaugurated in 1883. It was 
          the first municipal hospital and today is called Ramos Mej&iacute;a 
          Hospital. It&#8217;s placed at the intersection of Urquiza Street and 
          Venezuela Street. It was preceded by San Roque&#8217;s Lazzareto (1867), 
          bound for patients with contagious diseases. That was the reason for 
          which it was chosen a country place &#8211;in that time- far from downtown 
          to establish it. It gave important services during the yellow fever 
          epidemic. Being Argentina a country of immigrants, several societies 
          were created to take care of their compatriots with economic, social 
          and health lacks. Among other services, the &#8220;community hospital&#8221; 
          was founded. Among them the French, Spanish, Italian and British hospitals. 
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Cemeteries: Formerly the dead were buried in the courtyards 
          of the churchs (except the poor or black people that were thrown in 
          the open country to be eaten by the wild dogs). Those burials were forbidden 
          in 1822. Because of this, the <em>Recoleta Cemetery</em> was founded. 
          In 1867 was inaugurated the Southern Cemetery, quickly filled because 
          of the consecutive epidemics of cholera and yellow fever. It was closed 
          in 1892, becoming the current Florentino Ameghino Park. Near this place, 
          in Spain Square existed a small cemetery for English people. The towns 
          of Belgrano and Flores also had cemeteries. <br>

          concluy&oacute; en dos meses, la dirigi&oacute; el ingeniero Augusto 
          Ringuelet. Al tren que cumpl&iacute;a la l&uacute;gubre misi&oacute;n 
          de transportar los cad&aacute;veres se lo conoc&iacute;a como de la 
          muerte o f&uacute;nebre, al igual que a las tres estaciones en la que 
          se depositaban los mismos para ser trasladados: la Bermejo, en la esquina 
          sudoeste de la calle hom&oacute;nima (hoy Jean Jaur&eacute;s) con la 
          avenida Corrientes, la que se encontraba en la esquina sudoeste de Corrientes 
          y Medrano; y la de la esquina con Scalabrini Ortiz (entonces llamada 
          Camino Ministro Ingl&eacute;s. Al mencionado tren lo sucedi&oacute; 
          el tranv&iacute;a F&uacute;nebre y a partir de &eacute;ste, en 1887, 
          la compa&ntilde;&iacute;a Lacroze obtuvo una concesi&oacute;n para extender 
          v&iacute;as por donde circular&iacute;a el llamado tranv&iacute;a Rural, 
          de tracci&oacute;n a sangre como todos los de esa &eacute;poca, desde 
          la actual Pueyrred&oacute;n hasta la Chacarita, por la actual Corrientes, 
          y de este &uacute;ltimo punto hacia Belgrano y de aqu&iacute; ramales 
          a la provincia. Este contrato se le otorg&oacute; con la condici&oacute;n 
          de que adem&aacute;s de pasajeros deb&iacute;an llevar cad&aacute;veres 
          hasta el cementerio. Eran tranv&iacute;as de techo abierto y asientos 
          de madera y fue principalmente gracias ellos que las viviendas se fueron 
          extendiendo sobre las quintas y los hornos de barro que a&uacute;n exist&iacute;an. 
          / - Finalmente, en 1871, la fiebre amarilla, que hace estragos entre 
          los pobladores hacinados en los conventillos de los barrios del sur 
          de la ciudad de Buenos Aires, cobra gran n&uacute;mero de vidas entre 
          ellos, terminando de hecho con la mayor parte de los hombres de color.</em>)<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; The<em> Recoleta Cemetery </em>was created in 1822 in 
          the vegetable garden that the priests recoletos possessed besides the 
          Del Pilar Church. <em>Chacarita Cemetery:</em> The yellow fever epidemic 
          of 1871 forced to find quickly another burial place. This cemetery was 
          called also &#8220;Western&#8221; between 1896 an 1949. There are buried 
          tango celebrities, outstanding among them Carlos Gardel, whose sculptural 
          group is object of offerings and rituals. The tombs of former President 
          Juan Per&oacute;n and the poetess Alfonsina Storni are also there. <em>Dissidents&#8217; 
          Cemetery:</em> In 1820 the English community got a permission to place 
          a cemetery at the rear of Socorro Church. Prior to this date, Protestants 
          were buried in the bank of the river, at the zone of Retiro. The second 
          dissidents&#8217; cemetery was located in the current First of May Square, 
          in Pasco Street and Alsina Street. These grounds were changed afterwards 
          by a piece of land adjacent to Chacarita Cemetery, where are placed 
          today the British and German cemeteries. <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; The National Penitentiary. It was settled on Las Heras 
          Avenue between Coronel D&iacute;az Avenue and Salguero Street. At about 
          1877 it had seven paranoptic shaped pavilions, usual in those years. 
          It was surrounded by a high wall with turrets. It was demolished in 
          1961, and today the Juan Gregorio de Las Heras Park is located there. 
          Several plates in the place remember the executions by shooting carried 
          out there after the military coup d&#8217;etat of 1955. <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Alvear Avenue: A hundred years ago petit hotels and mansions 
          had been built in this Avenue by families with big fortunes. This way 
          it became the most paradigmatic street in the North Quarter. Several 
          of those splendid residences, like that of Ortiz Basualdo or Pereda 
          families, became afterwards diplomatic head quarters. Today it is shown 
          as &#8220;the French Buenos Aires&#8221; to the foreign tourists. <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Sarmiento Avenue &#8211; called originally Palms Avenue- 
          extends from Italia Square to the Palermo Forests, ending in Rafael 
          Obligado Coastal Avenue. It was an elegant boulevard bound for strolling 
          of Buenos Aires&#8217; people. A hundred years ago the &#8220;Flowers 
          Carnival Parade&#8221; was celebrated there. <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Mayo Avenue: In 1886 during the mayorship of Torcuato 
          de Alvear, the demolitions that gave origin to Mayo Avenue from Bol&iacute;var 
          Street to Luis S&aacute;enz Pe&ntilde;a Street began. The Avenue was 
          inaugurated in July 9th, 1894, becoming the great stage for the public 
          and social life of the City of a hundred years ago. <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Subway ( Subte / subterr&aacute;neos): As in only ten 
          years, between 1903 and 1913, the number of inhabitants rose from 895.381 
          to 1.457.885, the construction of fast subway transport means became 
          the right solution to the astonishing growth of the city. The construction 
          and operation of <em>Line &quot;A&quot;</em> took 26 months. Newspapers 
          commented in great detail on the ongoing of the construction work and 
          its opening on December 1st, 1913, the first stage which reached Plaza 
          Miserere. The following day the subway was opened to the people, and 
          170.000 passengers traveled by this new transport means. On April 1st, 
          1914 R&iacute;o de Janeiro Station was inaugurated, and 90 days later 
          the last section of Line A until Primera Junta, was completed. The construction 
          of this line was the only one carried out &quot;under open sky&quot;. 
          1.500 persons were employed and 440.000 m3 of land were dug out and 
          used to fill the low areas surrounding the cemetery of Flores and Velez 
          Sarsfield Avenue. Ventilation, light, esthetics and final details were 
          carefully designed. It should also be mentioned that different colors 
          of tiles were used for the design of each station, so that people who 
          could not read, were able to easily identify the different stations. 
          The construction and operation of <em>Line &quot;C&quot;</em> started 
          in 1933. Records of that age described the growing unemployment, for 
          which reason Plaza Constituci&oacute;n was crowded with men from everywhere 
          in search of work. They would stay overnight waiting for a job. Every 
          morning the technicians and the foremen were harassed by the workers 
          to get a job, this situation resulted in the prompt completion of the 
          project. An important feature of this line was the introduction of a 
          beautiful decorative and luxury element: the artistic majolica paintings 
          which decorated the stations. These murals with landscapes of typical 
          regions of Spain.<br>

          <strong><font size="5" color=#663366>Urbanisation vs Slum Culture</font></strong> 
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Urbanisation is called the social transformation process 
          whereby cities grow and societies become more urban. However, in the 
          surrounding areas that were occupied during the second half of the 20th 
          century, official intervention has been less influential. Higher- and 
          lower-income population groups have created specific enclaves that show 
          growing social and spatial fragmentation. How is urbanization negatively 
          effecting our society? *&nbsp; &quot;Reflections on Urbanization and 
          Respect for the Slum Culture&quot; is one of the most profound writings 
          of analysis and understanding of the culture of the urban popular sectors. 
          It begins by saying that &quot;life in the slum&quot; has meant that 
          the priests have a &quot;particular perspective&quot; that differs from 
          the one that those living in other places might have. Contrary to the 
          politicians and formal society, who believe that among the poor everything 
          is &quot;need&quot; and negativity (drugs, violence, poverty), defend 
          &quot;a positive perspective on the culture that exists in the slum.&quot; 
          The slum culture is nothing but a rich popular culture of our Latin 
          American people. The slum culture has its own way of perceiving and 
          using public space. As such the street is the natural extension of one's 
          home, not simply a transit point, but a place where one creates ties 
          with the neighbors, where one finds the possibility to express oneself, 
          the place for popular celebrations. They reject the word &quot;urbanize,&quot; 
          because it is unilateral, comes from a position of power, and displays 
          a devaluation of the slum culture. <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Other expressions for the word &quot;slum&quot;: &quot;Shanty 
          town&quot;, (<em>shanty</em>: small primitive shelter used as a dwelling, 
          homes for the homeless, <em>Bidonville</em>). Shanty towns (also called 
          <em>squatter settlements camps</em>, <em>favelas</em> in Rio de Janeiro) 
          are settlements (sometimes illegal or unauthorized / sin autorizaci&oacute;n 
          ni control) of impoverished people who live in improvised dwellings 
          made from scrap. Shantytowns are also called asentamientos irregulares 
          (&quot;irregular settlements&quot; - informal) or villas de emergencia 
          (&quot;emergency villages&quot;). In most of Argentina, the <em>unqualified</em> 
          word <em>villa</em> usually refers to a <em>villa miseria</em> (misery 
          town/village). The villas draw people from several backgrounds. Many 
          of them are migrants, coming from poorer provinces or from impoverished 
          rural areas near the cities, especially during Per&oacute;n's first 
          government, and a smaller number are recent immigrants from neighbouring 
          countries (especially Paraguay and more recently Bolivia). Others are 
          local citizens who have fallen from an already precarious economic position. 
          <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Villa 31</strong>, one of the best-known slums 
          in Buenos Aires, located in Retiro on &quot;tierras p&uacute;blicas&quot; 
          (public lands since 1930, used to house families of unemployed dockworkers 
          / a familias de obreros portuarios desempleados por la crisis de 1929) 
          belonging to the port of Buenos Aires and the main railroad terminal, 
          in 1940 used to house European immigrants. Today, as 30.000 to 70.000 
          persons are living in the <em>villa 31 y 31 bis</em> on the &quot;terrenos 
          ferroviarios federales&quot;, it is an urgent and delicate social urbanisation 
          problem for &quot;El Gobierno porte&ntilde;o&quot;. (Un arquitecto se 
          hizo pasar por fumigador durante un mes en la villa 31, y realiz&oacute; 
          un relevamiento de la situaci&oacute;n urban&iacute;stica del asentamiento 
          de Retiro. Seg&uacute;n un viejo censo oficial, viven all&iacute; unas 
          30 mil personas. Conforme los c&aacute;lculos del actual gobierno, ya 
          son 40 mil y 70 mil a juicio de los habitantes del asentamiento. Hay 
          que evitar que la villa se siga expandiendo, porque es realmente peligroso 
          lo que est&aacute; sucediendo ah&iacute;.) <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Vanishing Cultures -</strong> There's a tendency 
          for those of us in the dominant Western culture to view traditional 
          people&#8212;even when we're sympathetic to their plight&#8212;as quaint 
          and colorful, but reduced to the sidelines of history, while the real 
          world, which of course is our world, continues moving forward. We see 
          these societies as failed attempts at modernity, as if they're destined 
          to fade away by some natural law, as if they can't cope with change. 
          That's simply not true. Change is the one constant in history. All societies 
          in all times and in all places constantly adapt to new possibilities 
          for life. It's not change per se that threatens the integrity of the 
          ethnosphere, nor is it technology. It is power&#8212;the crude face 
          of domination. In every instance, these societies are not failed attempts 
          of modernity. They're not archaic, destined to fade away. They are dynamic, 
          living, vital cultures that are being driven out of existence by identifiable 
          external forces. These other cultures are not failed attempts to be 
          us; they are unique manifestations of the spirit&#8212;other options, 
          other visions of life itself. Torn from the past, they're propelled 
          into an uncertain future, often in a very insecure place on the lowest 
          economic ladder that goes nowhere. With each group that is uprooted 
          or assimilated, a culture vanishes. <br>

          <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; So, when you&#8217;re all dressed up to hit the milongas, 
          you probably cross dark shadows searching for garbage in the streets 
          of Buenos Aires. They are called &quot;cartoneros&quot;, once factory 
          workers, farmers, or low-wage workers who lost their jobs during Argentina's 
          2002 economic collapse and are since surviving by collecting cardboard, 
          plastic and glass from the wealthy neighborhoods of Buenos Aires and 
          selling them to recycling companies. Working as a cartonera, or trash 
          scavenger, involves going through bags of rubbish and separating out 
          the material into different bags. When the Argentine economy collapsed 
          in late December 2001, the residents of Jos&eacute; Le&oacute;n Su&aacute;rez, 
          a neighborhood on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, were among the first 
          to lose their jobs. In the following months many, faced with the prospect 
          of starvation, joined <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piquetero" title="Origins_Piqueteros_piquete_picket" target="_blank">piquetero</a> 
          organizations (<em>Movimientos de Trabajadores Desocupados</em>, MTDs) 
          informal networks dedicated to mutual aid and often destructive political 
          protest. In Jos&eacute; Le&oacute;n Su&aacute;rez, residents successfully 
          lobbied the government to begin nightly train service from their community 
          to the more salubrious neighborhoods of downtown Buenos Aires, where 
          cartoneros, cardboard collectors, sort through the day's trash in search 
          of recyclable material that can be exchanged for money. <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Today, according to the International Red Cross, some 
          2,000 cartoneros use the train. Volunteers staff a nursery school so 
          that children will have a safe place to be while their parents are at 
          work every night. In the evening, the cartoneros pile on to a government-supplied 
          train, a stripped-down wreck without seats, heat for the winter, or 
          air-conditioning for the summer. El Tren Blanco, or the &#8220;white 
          train,&#8221; as most cartoneros call it, leaves downtown Buenos Aires 
          before dawn. Most Argentines never see the cartoneros. The poor, as 
          everyone knows, are invisible. Aware of their invisibility, the cartoneros 
          have taken to calling the train El Tren del Fantasma, or the <a href="http://www.worldpress.org/photo_essays/cartoneros/" title="Photos by Andrea di Martino: The Ghost Train of the Cartoneros" target="_blank">&#8220;Ghost 
          Train.&#8221;</a><BR>

          &nbsp; &nbsp; Not so long ago, <a href="http://images.google.be/images?hl=nl&q=Daniela+Cott+&gbv=2" title="Argentinian model Daniella Cott" target="_blank">Daniela 
          Cott </a>was one of those Buenos Aires' 'cartoneras', one of the many 
          people scavenging through rubbish on the streets of Argentina's capital. 
          Daniela says it wasn't a nice way to make a living and she didn't like 
          doing it but had to do it to help her family. Then, in mid-2005, <strong>Daniela&#8217;s 
          cinderella story from cartonera to model began</strong>: One evening, 
          Ms. Marina Gonz&aacute;lez Winkler, a necklace designer, saw Daniela 
          Cott on the street wearing a baseball cap and carrying a couple of trash 
          bags. Noting that Ms. Cott was about her size, the designer offered 
          her some clothes she wasn't wearing anymore. Ms. Cott gratefully accepted. 
          The next evening Ms. Cott showed up at Ms. Gonz&aacute;lez's door with 
          a bloody hand she'd cut on a tin can. Ms. Gonz&aacute;lez helped bandage 
          the wound, and their friendship was sealed. One day in early 2006, Ms. 
          Gonz&aacute;lez shot photos of Ms. Cott on her terrace modeling sportswear 
          she'd given her. &quot; 'You weren't born to be a cartonera,' &quot; 
          Ms. Cott recalls her friend saying. Ms. Gonz&aacute;lez took the shots 
          to a powerful modeling agent, Ricardo Pineiro. The agency gave Ms. Cott 
          a free modeling course, with lessons on applying makeup, walking in 
          high heels and conversing with designers. Daniella Cott gradually stopped 
          working as garbage recycler to focus on her new career. <BR>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; In 2006, a friend of Ms. Gonz&aacute;lez's who owned a 
          youth-oriented clothing label gave Ms. Cott her first job as a photographic 
          model. Last year, Ms. Cott's representatives approached another designer, 
          Vanesa L&oacute;pez, who was preparing for a fashion show. Ms. L&oacute;pez 
          says she pondered how an association with a cartonera would affect the 
          label that bears her name. &quot;There's a lot of discrimination in 
          Argentina,&quot; Ms. L&oacute;pez says. Ultimately, Ms. L&oacute;pez 
          says, &quot;I decided to take a chance and try to turn Cinderella into 
          a princess.&quot; Ms. L&oacute;pez said Daniella Cott was a natural 
          on the catwalk and the show got great publicity for her clothing. That 
          experience gave Ms. Cott courage to enter the Elite competition, in 
          which 1,000 applicants were whittled down to 18 finalists. Ms. Cott 
          was one of the youngest contenders in the finals, which included swimsuit 
          and evening-dress competitions. &quot;I didn't think I had a chance,&quot; 
          she says. Ms. Cott still lives at home, and hasn't earned enough from 
          her modeling to transform her family's economic circumstances. A couple 
          of her brothers still scavenge. <BR>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Daniela Cott made headlines before the Elite competition 
          with the help of her agents, who pitched her Cinderella story to the 
          local press. Television appearances followed. Denise Dumas, a model 
          who hosts a TV fashion and health show, had Ms. Cott as a guest last 
          year. &quot;I saw her in the studio and she was divine, tall with wonderful 
          skin,&quot; she says. Then Ms. Dumas got closer and saw Daniela Cott's 
          hands. &quot;There were calluses, cuts, scars, dark blotches and dry 
          patches,&quot; says Ms. Dumas. Stigmata, like Christianity marks resembling 
          the wounds of the crucified Christ. &quot;That's when I really began 
          to understand what Daniela had been through.&quot; Daniela Cott has 
          since undergone extensive dermatological treatment on her hands to help 
          heal the scars of scavenging. She says she wants to use her celebrity 
          to press the government to supply all trash pickers with protective 
          gloves. The young model says she's not ashamed of having worked as a 
          cartonera, &quot;because that gave me a very strong character and taught 
          me not to be afraid of anything.&quot; &#8220;I don&#8217;t mind having 
          been a &#8220;cartonera&#8221;, it is part of my life but I do mind 
          when people insult me&#8221;, she says. In the competitive world of 
          modeling, she knows that it will probably take time for people to forget 
          the stigma of who she was. She is the &#8220;cartonera model&#8221; 
          and will probably remain so in her country.<BR>
          <BR>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; In Argentina, there's already talk of a film and book 
          about the miracle makeover. Being a former cartonera makes her a great 
          rags-to-riches &quot;Cenicienta&quot;-tale. In a photo spread for a 
          local newspaper in August, she was shot in a denim miniskirt in front 
          of a line of grimy-looking scavengers. <BR>
          <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet being a cartonera carries a <em>stigma</em> in Argentina. 
          In a country that has long identified itself as much with Europe as 
          Latin America, there is deep ambivalence towards the scavengers who 
          take over the streets at night. <BR>
          <BR>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Scavenging was for many years illegal under a decree issued 
          by a military dictatorship in the 1970s. The law wasn't overturned until 
          2002, after a crippling recession had forced thousands of Argentines 
          to pick refuse to survive. There were at the time an estimated 100,000 
          scavengers on the streets. The numbers went down in recent years due 
          to a slight economic recovery, but there are still an estimated 6,000 
          &#8220;scavengers&#8221;, according to the latest census. The official 
          number is 3,200, but did not include children and people who did not 
          want to participate in the survey. With an unemployment rate of 8 %, 
          down from 21.5% in 2002, the government has recognized the economic 
          and environmental benefits of informal recycling: huge savings on garbage 
          collection and a 25 percent reduction in the city's solid waste going 
          to landfills. In 2003, in the metropolis, one could find as many as 
          40.000 cartoneros. The law 992 had just been passed, giving a legal 
          status to this activity. The economy is in better shape now, but there 
          are still an estimated 10,000 scavengers who sell their findings to 
          recycling centers. The Buenos Aires train company recently &quot;canceled&quot; 
          a special train that carried trash-pickers downtown from their barrios. 
          The company blamed vandalism on the route; scavengers claim discrimination.

          &nbsp; &nbsp; Some cartoneras have organized themselves to earn more 
          money like Cristina Lescano who founded El Ceibo, a cooperative of cartoneras. 
          After losing her job as a community worker in the late 80&#8217;s, Cristina 
          remembers that trash picking was the only option left to feed her family. 
          &#8220;We were only 7 women at the beginning. We entered a new world, 
          a world of men at night. At first they gave us a cold stare, but soon 
          we did the job together: women, men and also our children. Some neighbors 
          felt pity for us when they saw us, others looked down on us, but now 
          our relationship has changed&#8221;. Today, some 2,400 neighbors collaborate 
          with El Ceibo by sorting out plastics, glass and cardboard that is being 
          collected by the staff every morning. The cooperative, named after a 
          local tree, now supports 53 families and operates mainly in Palermo, 
          an upper class district in Buenos Aires. Stacking cardboard on her cart, 
          Maria Luisa, who has been trash picking for the past seven years, explains 
          that the big change now is the recognition they get from the authorities 
          and local communities. &#8220;Working at night is a marginal job&#8221;, 
          explains Cristina who felt ashamed each time she had to go out to &#8220;cirujear&#8221;, 
          another synonym for trash scavenging. <br>

          <font size="5" color=#663366><strong>En Argentina, no hay negros... </strong></font><br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; <em>Un mecanismo de invisibilizaci&oacute;n</em> fue sistem&aacute;ticamente 
          aplicado a los afroargentinos, grupo al que se consider&oacute; &quot;desaparecido&quot; 
          en alg&uacute;n momento de la segunda mitad del siglo XIX, sin que hasta 
          el presente exista una explicaci&oacute;n razonable para la desaparici&oacute;n 
          de un sector que representaba el 30% de la poblaci&oacute;n total pocos 
          a&ntilde;os antes. Tambi&eacute;n se ha desarrollado una pol&iacute;tica 
          de invisibilizaci&oacute;n para con los inmigrantes de otros pa&iacute;ses 
          latinoamericanos y sus descendientes, que en algunos casos han constituido 
          comunidades mayores y m&aacute;s antiguas que las de la mayor&iacute;a 
          de los grupos europeos que migraron a la Argentina. <br>
          &nbsp; La misma ideolog&iacute;a que sostiene que &quot;en Argentina 
          no hay negros&quot; utiliza la palabra &quot;negros&quot; para denominar 
          a una masa mayoritaria de la poblaci&oacute;n integrada por trabajadores, 
          pobres, migrantes internos, inmigrantes latinoamericanos, ind&iacute;genas, 
          sin demasiada distinci&oacute;n. &quot;Grone&quot; (&quot;ne-gro&quot;, 
          al rev&eacute;s) tambi&eacute;n es un t&eacute;rmino racista de amplia 
          utilizaci&oacute;n en la Argentina, especialmente en Buenos Aires. Se 
          trata de una palabra del lunfardo rioplatense, el vesre, que consiste 
          en pronunciar las palabra invirtiendo sus s&iacute;labas. Un grone no 
          es necesariamente una persona negra, ni de piel oscura. B&aacute;sicamente 
          es una persona a la que se desprecia por su condici&oacute;n social, 
          frecuentemente un trabajador o hijo de &eacute;ste, perteneciente a 
          la clase baja o media baja. Puede dec&iacute;rsele grone tambi&eacute;n 
          a una persona de piel muy clara, cabello rubio y ojos azules, si pertenece 
          a la clase baja o expresa gustos culturales populares. M&aacute;s recientemente 
          ha comenzado a ser habitual, en este tipo de racismo, asociar la condici&oacute;n 
          de grone -o negro- a la delincuencia. <br>
          &nbsp; El proceso de invisibilizaci&oacute;n ha sido ejecutado mediante 
          m&uacute;ltiples formas. Una de ellas ha sido la manipulaci&oacute;n 
          de los censos, para reducir y hasta eliminar los registros relacionados 
          con personas o culturas no europeas. El proceso de invisibilizaci&oacute;n 
          en las publicaciones sociales y escolares se realiza mediante t&eacute;cnicas 
          sutiles de manipulaci&oacute;n de textos, mediante los modos de denominar 
          y adjetivar, cuando no en la abierta omisi&oacute;n de los hechos sociales 
          o la falsificaci&oacute;n de los mismos. <br>
          &nbsp; <em>Visibilizaci&oacute;n e Invisibilizaci&oacute;n</em>: La 
          Argentina intenta seguir viviendo la ilusi&oacute;n de ser un pa&iacute;s 
          racialmente homog&eacute;neo, mayormente europeo y, por ende, blanco, 
          donde la discriminaci&oacute;n no existe. La invisibilizaci&oacute;n 
          de los pueblos originarios es una de las formas de discriminaci&oacute;n. 
          En la medida en que se niega la existencia, los pueblos ind&iacute;genas 
          reclaman derechos que no les dan y no se los dan porque &quot;no existen&quot;. 
          La cultura dominante no lo ve, lo invisibiliza. Invisibilidad, la imposibilidad 
          de ser visto. <br>
          &nbsp; Entonces, a los pueblos ind&iacute;genas se les est&aacute; negando 
          la propia existencia. Ya no se les niegan los derechos, se les niega 
          la existencia. Es una negativa m&aacute;s radical. &quot;No tenemos 
          el problema ind&iacute;gena en Argentina.&quot; Como si los ind&iacute;genas 
          fueran un problema. Es el caso de la &quot;superioridad&quot; con la 
          que se autoperciben muchos argentinos respecto del resto de latinoamericanos, 
          y tantos costarricenses respecto de los centroamericanos. Es la dial&eacute;tica 
          del enano que necesita bajarle el piso a los dem&aacute;s para saberse 
          grande. Es una absurda guerra de espejos. &quot;Parece negro&quot; o 
          &quot;parece indio&quot;, son insultos frecuentes en Am&eacute;rica 
          latina; y &quot;parece blanco&quot; es un frecuente homenaje. La mezcla 
          con sangre negra o india &quot;atrasa la raza&quot;; la mezcla con sangre 
          blanca &quot;mejora la especie&quot;. <br>
          &nbsp; <em>Hay una cuesti&oacute;n de clase.</em> No podemos ignorar 
          que pesa sobre nosotros toda una cultura colonialista, hay una concepci&oacute;n 
          de que el ind&iacute;gena es alguien atrasado, culturalmente inferior, 
          es un racismo de ra&iacute;z cultural en la clase media argentina. Se 
          los ve como personas de otra cultura, con una inclinaci&oacute;n etnocentrista 
          a considerarlas de una cultura inferior. La clase media discrimina a 
          los pueblos originarios por una ra&iacute;z de clase y etnia. <br>
          &nbsp; El t&eacute;rmino <em>cabecita negra</em> tiene un inocultable 
          componente de clase: est&aacute; dirigido a un tipo definido de trabajador 
          y trabajadora que compuso el grueso de la nueva clase obrera industrial 
          que se desarroll&oacute; a partir de 1935 y se expandi&oacute; velozmente 
          a partir de 1939. <br>
          &nbsp; <em>Esta nueva clase obrera</em> se instal&oacute; en los m&aacute;rgenes 
          de la ciudad de Buenos Aires y otras ciudades en menor medida, modificando 
          completamente su composici&oacute;n social. El proletariado, la nueva 
          clase obrera, es un t&eacute;rmino utilizado para designar a la clase 
          social m&aacute;s baja de la &eacute;poca de la edad moderna que, en 
          el modo de producci&oacute;n capitalista, se ve obligada a vender su 
          fuerza de trabajo a la burguesia por carecer de los medios de producci&oacute;n. 
          Un miembro de tal clase es llamado un proletario. El t&eacute;rmino 
          se utiliz&oacute; inicialmente en un sentido despectivo, hasta que Karl 
          Marx lo utiliz&oacute; en un sentido positivo para identificar lo que 
          &eacute;l llam&oacute; la clase obrera (ahora, en la sociedad de consumo, 
          la clase media), diferenciando proletariado y lumpenproletariado (&quot;homo 
          sacer&quot; hombre sin derechos / marginalized elements of society) 
          y coloc&aacute;ndole como un grupo antag&oacute;nico a la clase burguesa.<br>

          <BR>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Durante tres a&ntilde;os, Daniela Cott trabaj&oacute; 
          como cartonera. Los d&iacute;as de Daniela Cott transcurr&iacute;an 
          entre botellas, cartones y bolsas de basura. Todas las tardes sal&iacute;a 
          a cartonear. Hasta que un cazador de talentos qued&oacute; deslumbrado 
          por sus ojos verdes y su inquietante belleza y le propuso ser modelo. 
          Daniela cartoneaba por algunas avenidas y calles de Palermo con uno 
          de sus hermanitos y una t&iacute;a. A la ma&ntilde;ana iba al colegio 
          y a las 5 de la tarde viajaban para Capital. Como consecuencia de su 
          trabajo, sus manos est&aacute;n &aacute;speras, cortadas, y en la agencia 
          las cuidan ahora con un tratamiento especial. <br>
          <BR>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Daniela Cott, de l&#8217;ombre &agrave; la lumi&egrave;re.</strong> 
          D&eacute;couverte &agrave; Buenos Aires alors qu&#8217;elle fouillait 
          dans les poubelles pour faire vivre sa famille, Daniela Cott est aujourd&#8217;hui 
          un top model en vogue. Malgr&eacute; le succ&egrave;s, on ne s&#8217;affranchit 
          pas si facilement de son pass&eacute;, surtout quand on est une ancienne 
          &quot;cartonera&quot;. Elle faisait partie de ceux que personne ne voulait 
          voir, les cartoneros, parias de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; argentine. 
          V&eacute;ritable cendrillon moderne, Daniela inspire les plus grands 
          r&eacute;alisateurs comme Pedro Almodovar qui souhaite adapter sa vie 
          au cin&eacute;ma. Son histoire ressemble &agrave; un conte de f&eacute;e. 
          <BR>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Comme toutes les histoires de Disney, le d&eacute;but 
          est catastrophique. La crise &eacute;conomique en Argentine au d&eacute;but 
          des ann&eacute;es 2000 a plong&eacute; sa famille dans la mis&egrave;re. 
          Daniela ainsi que ses neufs fr&egrave;res et s&#339;urs a &eacute;t&eacute; 
          contrainte de fouiller les poubelles et autre d&eacute;charges &agrave; 
          la recherche de mat&eacute;riaux &agrave; revendre. La jeune fille gagnait 
          alors 5 euros pas jour. Mais son pass&eacute; l&#8217;a rattrap&eacute;e. 
          Plusieurs magazines ont refus&eacute; de publier sa photo en apprenant 
          qu&#8217;elle avait &eacute;t&eacute; une cartonera. Hormis ce triste 
          incident, la carri&egrave;re de Daniela est en marche, loin des montagnes 
          de d&eacute;chets qui autrefois constituaient son paysage. Seules ses 
          mains portaient les stigmates des premi&egrave;res ann&eacute;es de 
          sa vie d&#8217;ado. Verrues, cicatrices, ecchymoses, t&acirc;ches brunes 
          : &agrave; force d&#8217;&ecirc;tre plong&eacute;es dans les poubelles, 
          ses mains n&#8217;&eacute;taient pas dignes d&#8217;&ecirc;tre expos&eacute;es 
          en premi&egrave;re page des magazines. Mais avec un traitement dermatologique, 
          Daniela s'est d&eacute;fait de ce dernier obstacle pour embrasser une 
          carri&egrave;re de mannequin prometteuse. <BR>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Extirp&eacute;e des bas-fonds, la jeune fille garde la 
          t&ecirc;te froide. Plus effray&eacute;e que gris&eacute;e par le succ&egrave;s, 
          la top model vit toujours avec sa famille dans les bidonvilles et fr&eacute;quente 
          toujours la m&ecirc;me &eacute;cole. Elle redoute m&ecirc;me le jour 
          o&ugrave; son m&eacute;tier la contraindra &agrave; partir. Elle &eacute;conomise 
          d&#8217;ailleurs ses cachets pour offrir &agrave; sa famille une vraie 
          maison et trois repas par jour. A 16 ans, celle que l&#8217;on pr&eacute;sente 
          un peu h&acirc;tivement comme la nouvelle Eva Peron, surnomm&eacute;e 
          &quot;la madonne des sans-chemises&quot;, souhaite devenir en tout cas 
          la voix des exclus. Modestement, elle a demand&eacute; au gouvernement 
          argentin de fournir des gants aux cartoneros. Pour qu&#8217;eux n'aient 
          jamais honte de leurs mains.<br>
          <BR>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Familie hatte w&auml;hrend <strong>der gro&szlig;en Wirtschaftskrise</strong> 
          2001 kein Geld mehr, um die vielen Kinder zu ern&auml;hren, und beschloss, 
          als Cartoneros zu arbeiten, als M&uuml;llsammler. Die beiden Frauen 
          kauften sich einen Handwagen und nahmen alle mit auf ihre allabendliche 
          Tour, die Kinder, Enkel, auch die Babys. Sie zogen durch die Stra&szlig;en 
          des wohlhabenden Stadtteils Palermo, &ouml;ffneten M&uuml;lls&auml;cke, 
          trennten Papier, Glas und Metall und verkauften es an Zwischenh&auml;ndler. 
          Sie w&uuml;hlten sich durch Essensreste, Schimmel, durch Frauenbinden 
          und Kot, sie kamen nach Hause mit 400 Pesos pro Woche (knapp 100 Euro) 
          f&uuml;r die ganze Familie. <BR>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Man erwartet nun ein gro&szlig;es Lamento, doch die Gro&szlig;mutter 
          Juana Rold&aacute;n sagt, nicht ohne Melancholie: &quot;Es waren f&uuml;nf 
          harte Jahre, aber es war eine gute Zeit. Ich vermisse sie manchmal.&quot; 
          - &quot;Es war ein gro&szlig;es Abenteuer, jeden Abend ein Familienausflug 
          mit Sack und Pack, manchmal mussten wir k&auml;mpfen und unser Territorium 
          verteidigen.&quot; Sie erz&auml;hlen noch eine Weile von damals, so 
          wie Veteranen vom Krieg erz&auml;hlen, von den gro&szlig;en Schlachten 
          der Stra&szlig;e, von ihrem Recht auf M&uuml;ll, als w&auml;re dies 
          ein Menschenrecht. Da sitzt eine Gruppe starker Frauen, die das K&auml;mpfen 
          lernten und ihre W&uuml;rde fanden. Daniela, &quot;La Cartonera&quot;, 
          gerade 14 Jahre alt, wurde eingeladen zu weiteren Fotoshootings und 
          einem halbj&auml;hrigen Modeltraining. &quot;Negra&quot; nannte man 
          sie abf&auml;llig, nicht weil sie schwarze Haut hatte, sondern weil 
          sie aus der Armut kam, der Peripherie, in einem Land, in dem die Postleitzahl 
          das gr&ouml;&szlig;te Stigma sein kann. Daniela war d&uuml;nner als 
          alle anderen und entsprach so gar nicht dem g&auml;ngigen argentinischen 
          Ideal: schlank, aber kurvig, mit &quot;mucha carne&quot;, wie sie sagen, 
          viel Fleisch, etwas zum Zupacken. Daniela Cott, &quot;La negra&quot;, 
          aus dem Armenviertel &quot;Eva Per&oacute;n&quot;. Eine &quot;Negra&quot;. 
          Aus einer Villa Miseria, einem Slum. Ohne Benehmen. Ohne W&uuml;rde 
          und Klasse. Ein kleines Erdbeben stattfand im klassenbewussten Argentinien.<br>
