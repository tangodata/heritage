        <strong><font color="#CC0000" size="4">Zeitgeist Candy, conforming view 
        in a culture</font></strong> <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp; Eye candy is something that is most remarkable for its visual appeal. 
        The term mediascape describes the way that visual imagery impacts the 
        world. Such imagery comes from books, magazines, television, cinema, and, 
        above all, advertising that can directly impact the landscape and also 
        subtly influence, through persuasive techniques and an increasingly pervasive 
        presence, the way that people perceive reality. That &quot;timespirit&quot; 
        or &quot;esprit du si&egrave;cle&quot;, does not indicate a homogenous 
        state of affairs in which everyone goes along with the same idea, but 
        rather expresses the fact that in any given society, there is a certain 
        &#8220;language&#8221;, culture or range of concepts. The mass media plays 
        a crucial role in forming and reflecting public opinion: it communicates 
        the world to individuals, and it reproduces modern society's self-image. 
        Mass media force attention to certain issues. The real key is to get people 
        to begin obsessing. The obsessing keyword during this decade is Sexyness. 
        Sex appeal or looking sexy is about an <em>exterior</em> appearance. It 
        can be related to self-perception, self-awareness, self consciousness, 
        ego. A feeling of self-consciousness occurs when we realize that we are 
        being watched or observed, the feeling that "everyone is looking". When 
        feeling self-conscious, one becomes aware of even the smallest of one's 
        own actions, self-objectification, appearance-obsessed. As a result, nothing 
        happens in the public domain, they do not move. An example is Samuel Beckett&#8217;s 
        famous play &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, belonging to what is classified 
        as <em>the theatre of the absurd</em>.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp; When the child looks at his reflection in front of a mirror (le 
        stade du miroir), the reflected &quot;startling spectacle&quot; establishes 
        the idea of subjectivity or ego. At the age of six months, the infant 
        is introduced the idea of the difference between self / other. The emphasis 
        here is on the process of identification with an outside image or entity 
        that extends from a fragmented body-image to a form of its <em>totality</em>. 
        This is the start of a lifelong process of identifying the self in terms 
        of the Other. A perceptual relationship to another of the same species 
        is necessary in the normal maturing process. Without the visual presence 
        of others, the maturing process is delayed. <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp; Today, there is no shortage of visual presence of others, it's 
        an overwhelming cultural phenomenon. Faced with large social groupings 
        (big cities), multiple influences (media, advertising, peer group and 
        family pressures, social expectations), and fast moving technology (internet, 
        email, mobile phones, iPods), things are caused to go more rapidly, speeded 
        up or sexed up. Not only is the mirror on the wall at home but media representations, 
        conversations with friends and other forms of social feedback interweave 
        with one&#8217;s (dance) life, one&#8217;s (self) perception and today's 
        emphasis is on <em>the visual image</em>. Are dancers too often working 
        to achieve an image of what they think dancing is, rather than achieving 
        an understanding and an experience of the dance? Is there a relation between 
        the renewed popular interest in dancing and today's longing, yearning 
        and desire to <a href="http://www.zonalatina.com/Zldata125.htm" title="zonalatina" target="_blank">stay 
        eternally young and beautiful</a>? Anyway, things are looking sexier than 
        ever.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp; Is dancing an esthetic experience, a contemporary lifestyle? One 
        can say that significant interior feelings like joy, make an exterior 
        appearance meaningful. From <em>the interior feelings</em>, the dance 
        derives <em>its sense of motion as a whole</em>. To make dance a living, 
        ongoing event, there must be this, rather magical internal trigger for 
        action. It is like playing piano, it is not the same as typing notes, 
        an inner soul has to touch the fingers. A musician is expressing himself 
        through his instrument and connecting awareness to the whole body. He 
        is not unpacking a digital audio format. Dancing on life music feels much 
        different from a mp3 audio file which encodes music into a technological 
        form. We interact through all our senses, the sensing body in movement 
        has much more layers than a visual image in a modern, virtual environment.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp; Introspection captures the intention, not just the physical, outward 
        expression. Action only deals with physical movement: the action line, 
        the axis. Physical movement however, has a non-physical counterpart: its 
        essence, its movement identity. Gesture involves not only physical movement, 
        but a deeper concept of identity. One can only make tactile contact if 
        an appearance has a deeper emotional substance, a lived-body is behind 
        the appearance. Touching another person is a form of physical intimacy 
        and plays an important role in dance. Bodiliness is the fact that when 
        you move your body, incoming sensory information immediately changes. 
        Bodiliness is one aspect of sensory stimulation which makes it different 
        from other forms of stimulation, and contributes to giving it its peculiar 
        quality. Because of bodiliness, corporeality, sensory information has 
        an &quot;intimate&quot; quality: it's almost as though it were part of 
        your own body.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp; Today's &quot;timespirit&quot; expresses a certain &quot;language&quot; 
        to act like the others in society, a drive to uniformity. That certain 
        &quot;language&quot; or &quot;La forza del destino&quot;, can be related 
        to self-objectification. It involves adopting a third-person perspective 
        on the physical self and constantly assessing one&#8217;s own body in 
        an effort to conform to the culture&#8217;s appearance ideal.&nbsp; Objectification, 
        the act of representing an abstraction as a physical thing. Though portraying 
        oneself solely as an object to be looked at is sometimes viewed as exercising 
        <em>control</em>, presentation of the self in this way can be viewed as 
        a form of self-objectification. That is, they internalized an observer&#8217;s 
        standard of appearance and are engaged in activities designed to enhance 
        their sexual attractiveness. One can say that a catwalk is not about interior 
        feelings. Objectification will not affect all individuals equally, but 
        certain situations that accentuate a person's awareness of observers' 
        perspectives on their bodies are likely to enhance self-objectification. 
        One group that might be expected to be particularly high in self-objectification 
        are dancers. Most of the dancer&#8217;s time is spent in the studio where 
        the mirror is omnipresent. The dance room is incomplete without a mirror. 
        The mirror is objective. The mirror does not lie and it is a constant 
        reminder to the dancer of surveillance. <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp; Of central importance to Objectification Theory, is that objectification 
        in our society influences people to internalise the views present in society 
        and to begin viewing themselves in the same way. That is, girls and boys 
        gradually learn to adopt an observer's perspective on their physical selves 
        and to treat themselves as an object to be looked at and evaluated on 
        the basis of appearance. Fredrickson and Roberts (1997) term this particular 
        perspective &quot;self-objectification,&quot; and describe it as a form 
        of self-consciousness that is characterised by habitual and <em>constant 
        self-monitoring of one's outward appearance </em> to a prescribed ideal 
        image. The constant monitoring of appearance accompanying self-objectification 
        has a number of negative behavioural and experiential consequences. Internalising 
        an observer's objectifying perspective is <em>incompatible</em> with a 
        creative, playful or attentive state of mind. Further, habitual self-monitoring 
        of outward appearance results in a diminished awareness of internal body 
        states. The attention is turned away from the experience as a living, 
        inner experience. Selfobjectification diverts attention, with people monitoring 
        their own bodies as a reaction to (or in anticipation of) the objectifying 
        gaze of others (gaze anticipation). In a society in which the individual 
        is relentlessly confronted with a massive cultural production of unattainable 
        role models, we find ourselves increasingly under pressure to conform.

        <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp; The aesthetic awareness in the last decade shows a transformation. 
        Behind the excessive worship of beauty as a fetish or beaut&eacute; f&eacute;tiche, 
        is a phobia for passing of time and an eradication of every trace of growing 
        older. Beauty is not an object of desire, being beautiful is being an 
        object of scientific investigation, perception rather than reality. Through 
        a mathematical formula for measuring the female sexual attraction and 
        its possibilities to be very sensually, which is based on the curves proportion 
        between the width of the waist and of the hips. They have discovered that 
        the best relation waist-hips is a 0,7. Jessica Alba is scientifically 
        perfect. With tests math, the Hispanic superwoman has the perfect proportions 
        of that so sexy form. Another of the good-looking officials, the actress 
        Angelina Jolie, has a aesthetically pleasing proportion of a 0,75. These 
        perceptual measure-skills influence our aesthetic awareness. In everyday 
        life when we acquire new beliefs, we routinely draw inferences and update 
        our beliefs. Gradually, one adopts an observer's perspective. <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp; In &quot;Mismatch, <em>Why Our World No Longer Fits Our Bodies</em>&quot; 
        , the authors Peter Gluckman and Mark Hanson raise questions about the 
        growing mismatch of biological maturity and psychosocial maturity and 
        its associated challenges to a society often slow to evolve its own morals 
        and expectations. Due to improved nutrition, girls are now starting to 
        menstruate as as young as 10 and 11, but may not become emotionally and 
        intellectually mature for another decade, causing conflicts for teenagers, 
        schools and parents. Over the past 50 years the average age at which girls 
        exhibit the first signs of puberty has fallen to 8 years old. Meanwhile 
        brain development - including how to say no - is stuck where it always 
        has been, around 16. The problem is the same for boys: earlier puberty 
        contrasted with static brain development. Developed bodies and surging 
        hormones crossed with a world that treats them as children on one hand 
        and constantly reminds them of their sexuality on the other, adds up to 
        the kind of frustration you see every weekend at the city's shopping malls. 
        Young people demand freedom. Parents cling to control. Puberty is getting 
        earlier at the rate of a month's fall every two or three years. We now 
        live with a complexity that was never required before, which is compounded 
        by expectations and pressures that come from the impact of media. It's 
        also possible that the structures of society mean it actually takes longer 
        to mature as an adult. Society will get more complex, not less, so children 
        will take a long time to accumulate the life-skills to be adults. The 
        media will continue to drive messages to sell their products based on 
        reminding kids of their sexuality and their sex maturation. We have created 
        a modern, artificial world that is out of tune with our evolved bodies. 
        Our bodies have not yet evolved to match the rapidly changing environment 
        in the developed world. <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp; Meanwhile, more and more individuals are drawn to a counter culture 
        for the presentation of self in an unlimited scope. Youtube is such a 
        new meeting point to &quot;Broadcast Yourself&quot;. Web video continues 
        to enjoy enormous success and is increasingly becoming a standard feature 
        of websites and blogs. As we move towards the era of Internet TV, it gets 
        easier and easier for everyday people to broadcast their own video shows 
        to the world. The word millennium stands for more than a big change in 
        the counting of years, the landscape changes, the relations between humans 
        and their environments. <br>

        <strong>Internet, el nuevo ojo p&uacute;blico </strong><br>
        &nbsp; Algunos dicen que la moda es filmarse teniendo sexo. Al parecer, 
        el tema es mucho m&aacute;s que eso: buscar y encontrar &quot;esos&quot; 
        videos en los que personas reconocibles o famosas protagonizan escenas 
        caseras, colgarlos de la web y hasta pasarlos por la tele. Su aparici&oacute;n 
        en un video hot subido a Internet fue suficiente para ponerla en boca 
        de todos y tambi&eacute;n para que su nombre se tecleara en incontables 
        oportunidades. Apenas unos minutos de sexo expl&iacute;cito con alguien 
        que al menos tiene un fuerte parecido con la joven bastaron. Internet 
        y sus usuarios hicieron el resto. As&iacute;, &quot;Wanda Nara&quot; logr&oacute; 
        trepar hasta el primer puesto de las b&uacute;squedas. &quot;Video Wanda 
        Nara&quot; fue la serie de palabras que lleg&oacute; a figurar en la d&eacute;cima 
        ubicaci&oacute;n de ese mismo ranking. En horas se hablaba de Wanda y 
        Noelia Maxim en foros, blogs y sitios. Pero tambi&eacute;n en televisi&oacute;n 
        y radio, en colectivos y bares. La joven, no hay dudas, lleg&oacute; a 
        su m&aacute;ximo de popularidad. &iquest;Y por que no? &iexcl;Ahora puedes 
        ser tu! Si eres una mujer mayor de 18 a&ntilde;os, sientes adoraci&oacute;n 
        por los piercing y los tatuajes, sexy y te gusta ser admirada y deseada, 
        esta es la oportunidad en convertirte en una de las nuevas estrellas. 
        Nadie resiste a el nuevo videojuego. <br>
        &nbsp; La era de los videos hot hace historia, todo video prohibido es 
        bienvenido. Hoy este videoclip marca una nueva &eacute;poca y abre posibilidades 
        a los realizadores. S&oacute;lo basta una conexi&oacute;n a Internet y 
        un par de cliks para introducirse en el mundo de los videos on line. En 
        este fen&oacute;meno hay una clara marca de la &eacute;poca: toda esta 
        cosa m&aacute;s destapada, con menos pruritos, de exhibici&oacute;n del 
        cuerpo que est&aacute; presente en la sociedad en general, los adolescentes 
        tambi&eacute;n toman. Las &quot;descontroladas&quot; no juegan con mu&ntilde;ecas. 
        Se sacan fotos en ropa interior o desnudas y las suben a Internet y al 
        MSN a modo de presentaci&oacute;n. Se besan en p&uacute;blico, en la disco 
        y sin pudor alguno. Se rozan y se tocan. Los chicos mueren por ellas. 
        As&iacute; se divierten hoy las adolescentes sub 19 de la clase media 
        y alta argentina. Las chicas que aparecen como protagonistas de este fen&oacute;meno, 
        ya que es en este sector social en el que el cuerpo tiene un mayor valor 
        de exhibici&oacute;n y funciona como fetiche. Las j&oacute;venes aseguran 
        que &#8220;no son trolas ni tortas&#8221;, que todo &#8220;es parte de 
        un juego y nada m&aacute;s&#8221;. Para ellas es una diversi&oacute;n, 
        un nuevo videojuego.<br>

        &nbsp; Es curioso que tanta gente se agolpe para ver un cuerpo desnudo. 
        Hace muchos a&ntilde;os atr&aacute;s quiz&aacute;s era justificable, pero 
        no estamos en los setenta donde no se ve&iacute;a un cuerpo desnudo ni 
        de casualidad. La desnudez en los &aacute;mbitos p&uacute;blicos no est&aacute; 
        legitimada. No somos una sociedad nudista y llama la atenci&oacute;n lo 
        prohibitivo. La multitud ayuda a levantar los mecanismos de represi&oacute;n, 
        como pasa en las canchas de f&uacute;tbol. El marketing viral y la publicidad 
        viral son t&eacute;rminos empleados para referirse a las t&eacute;cnicas 
        de marketing que intentan explotar redes sociales preexistentes para producir 
        incrementos exponenciales en &quot;conocimiento de marca&quot;, mediante 
        procesos de autorreplicaci&oacute;n viral an&aacute;logos a la expansi&oacute;n 
        de un virus inform&aacute;tico. Se suele basar en el boca a oreja mediante 
        medios electr&oacute;nicos; usa el efecto de &quot;red social&quot; creado 
        por Internet y los modernos servicios de telefon&iacute;a m&oacute;vil 
        para llegar a una gran cantidad de personas r&aacute;pidamente. Tambi&eacute;n 
        se usa el t&eacute;rmino marketing viral para describir campa&ntilde;as 
        de marketing encubierto basadas en internet, incluyendo el uso de blogs, 
        de sitios aparentemente amateurs, y de otras formas de astroturfing dise&ntilde;adas 
        para crear el boca a oreja para un nuevo producto o servicio. Frecuentemente, 
        el objetivo de las campa&ntilde;as de marketing viral es generar cobertura 
        medi&aacute;tica mediante historias &quot;inusuales&quot;, por un valor 
        muy superior al presupuesto para publicidad de la compa&ntilde;&iacute;a 
        anunciante. El t&eacute;rmino publicidad viral se refiere a la idea que 
        la gente se pasar&aacute; y compartir&aacute; contenidos divertidos e 
        interesantes. Esta t&eacute;cnica a menudo est&aacute; patrocinada por 
        una marca, que busca generar conocimiento de un producto o servicio. Los 
        anuncios virales toman a menudo la forma de divertidos videoclips o juegos 
        Flash interactivos, im&aacute;genes, e incluso textos. <br>
        &nbsp; ** Internet explota y todo por una rubia que habr&iacute;a perdido 
        su c&aacute;mara digital durante sus vacaciones. El aparato fue encontrado 
        por un grupo de j&oacute;venes que subieron en una p&aacute;gina web im&aacute;genes 
        de las vacaciones. &iquest;Juegos en la arena? &iquest;Surf? No. Fotos 
        calientes y provocativas de la rubia con sus amigas. Sobre el caso de 
        la &quot;c&aacute;mara perdida&quot; ya hay repercusiones en todo el mundo 
        y en menos de 24 horas se generaron m&aacute;s de 600 p&aacute;ginas. 
        Si se trata de un plan de marketing para Internet, la historia no podr&iacute;a 
        ser mejor. <br>
        &nbsp; ** La bionda del Web, truffa o realt&agrave;? Il dubbio &egrave; 
        che si tratti di un'operazione di &quot;guerrilla marketing&quot;. La 
        signorina &egrave; bella, formosa, vistosa. E ha addosso un intenso profumo 
        di imbroglio. Quel sorriso, quella scollatura, corrono nel Web, sfilano 
        sui blog e animano il dibattito. E i dubbi di chi sospetta che la vicenda 
        in realt&agrave; non esista ma si tratti di una trovata pubblicitaria 
        low cost per promuovere qualcuno o qualcosa. Questa &egrave; la storia, 
        o la sua versione ufficiale: la ragazza nella foto ha smarrito la sua 
        fotocamera in Gran Bretagna, mentre era in vacanza. Qualcuno l'ha trovata, 
        le foto sono finite su internet, per la precisione sul social network 
        Facebook frequentato da oltre 12 milioni di utenti (tutti universitari). 
        L'interesse dei navigatori - un po' meno delle navigatrici - &egrave; 
        stato immediato. E su Facebook &egrave; nato un gruppo ad hoc, per dare 
        la caccia alla misteriosa bionda. Se &egrave; guerrilla marketing, &egrave; 
        fra le operazioni pi&ugrave; brillanti che mi siano mai capitate perch&eacute;, 
        pensi che mostrarsi in mutande e reggiseno procuri credibilit&agrave;? 
        Questa ragazza va aiutata. Perch&eacute; una che si fa le foto da sola, 
        mezza nuda, in una stanza, davanti allo specchio, certo non sta troppo 
        bene. Il sospetto, insomma, &egrave; che si tratti di una di quelle operazioni 
        che hanno lo scopo di far circolare il nome di societ&agrave;, prodotti 
        o servizi con una spesa minima e un'intuizione geniale. Il marketing virale 
        &egrave; un tipo di marketing non convenzionale che sfrutta la capacit&agrave; 
        comunicativa di pochi soggetti interessati per trasmettere il messaggio 
        ad un numero esponenziale di utenti finali. Il principio del viral marketing 
        si basa sull'originalit&agrave; di un'idea: qualcosa che, a causa della 
        sua natura o del suo contenuto, riesce a espandersi molto velocemente 
        in una data popolazione. Come un virus, l'idea che pu&ograve; rivelarsi 
        interessante per un utente, viene passata da questo ad altri contatti, 
        da questi ad altri e cos&igrave; via. In questo modo si espande rapidamente, 
        tramite il principio del &quot;passaparola&quot;, la conoscenza dell'idea. 
        <br>
        &nbsp; ** The digital camera blonde who attracted thousands of admirers 
        on Facebook has been exposed, she is a model who poses for X-rated pictures 
        online. The revealing site has admitted that it was all a &quot;clever 
        viral marketing campaign&quot;, it spreads like a virus. Viral marketing 
        and viral advertising refer to marketing techniques that use pre-existing 
        social networks to produce increases in brand awareness, through self-replicating 
        viral processes, analogous to the spread of pathological and computer 
        viruses. It can be word-of-mouth delivered or enhanced by the network 
        effects of the Internet. The term viral video refers to video clip content 
        which gains widespread popularity through the process of Internet sharing, 
        typically through email or IM messages, blogs and other media sharing 
        websites. Guerrilla marketing is an unconventional way of performing promotional 
        activities on a very low budget. Such promotions are sometimes designed 
        so that the target audience is left unaware they have been marketed to 
        and may therefore be a form of undercover marketing (also called stealth 
        marketing). <br>
        &nbsp; ** Le marketing viral est une forme de publicit&eacute; o&ugrave; 
        le consommateur contribue &agrave; sa diffusion. Depuis le d&eacute;veloppement 
        d&#8217;Internet et la d&eacute;mocratisation du haut d&eacute;bit, on 
        a pu voir se d&eacute;velopper de mani&egrave;re exponentielle ce nouveau 
        ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne. <br>
        &nbsp; ** Meanwhile, Natsuo Kirino is interviewed about Japan: Your novel 
        and many Japanese films from the last few years depict contemporary Japan 
        as an unsettled society whose outward calm masks an underlying current 
        of severe physical and psychological violence. Is this the case? -- The 
        old family system is collapsing more and more. Although the division between 
        men and women remains, a man now cannot sustain the entire family. We 
        have reached the point where women have to put the children into childcare 
        so that they can work to help support the family, too. Then, the children 
        themselves are under extreme educational pressure. So everybody is making 
        the best effort to sustain him or herself. It is a very confusing time 
        for our society. I have the feeling that people don't know what to do 
        to get out of their situations. Japanese adults are completely astounded, 
        and don't know what to do. That's the reality that we are getting into, 
        and it is getting worse. --- Natsuo Kirino’s description of female alienation 
        and self-destructiveness in contemporary Japan is chilling. Readers will 
        find themselves enchanted as though by some demented orchestra. Behind 
        this social critique of Japan as appearance-obsessed dystopia lurks a 
        series of more mystical and complex questions about the ultimate mystery 
        of human beauty. <br>

        <em>La imagen corporal y el super cuerpo</em> <br>
        &nbsp; Desde la d&eacute;cada de los 60 del siglo XX la investigaci&oacute;n 
        sobre imagen corporal ha recibido una importante atenci&oacute;n, y actualmente 
        disponemos gran cantidad de informaci&oacute;n sobre los factores implicados 
        en este concepto. La imagen corporal est&aacute; socialmente determinada. 
        Desde que se nace existen influencias sociales que matizan la autopercepci&oacute;n 
        del cuerpo. La imagen corporal no es fija o est&aacute;tica, m&aacute;s 
        bien es un constructo din&aacute;mico, que var&iacute;a a lo largo de 
        la vida en funci&oacute;n de las propias experiencias, de las influencias 
        sociales. La imagen corporal influye en el procesamiento de informaci&oacute;n, 
        la forma de percibir el mundo est&aacute; influencia por la forma en que 
        sentimos y pensamos sobre nuestro cuerpo. La imagen corporal influye en 
        el comportamiento, y no s&oacute;lo la imagen caporal consciente, sino 
        tambi&eacute;n la preconsciente y la inconsciente. <br>
        &nbsp; Desde <em>la teor&iacute;a de la objetivaci&oacute;n</em> se est&aacute; 
        planteando la explicaci&oacute;n m&aacute;s &uacute;til a la relaci&oacute;n 
        entre la imagen corporal y la expresi&oacute;n de la sexualidad. En esta 
        teor&iacute;a se considera quelas mujeres de la sociedad occidental est&aacute;n 
        inmersas en una cultura dominante masculina en la que se trata de forma 
        diferente los cuerpos de los hombres y de las mujeres. Esto tiene como 
        consecuencia que sea mucho m&aacute;s probable que el cuerpo de las mujeres 
        se mire, eval&uacute;e y sea potencialmente m&aacute;s objetivado que 
        el de los hombres. La interiorizaci&oacute;n del est&aacute;ndar social 
        en relaci&oacute;n al cuerpo, tal y como argumentala teor&iacute;a de 
        la objetivaci&oacute;n, implica que la persona sea consciente del est&aacute;ndar 
        y la creencia de que llevar a cabo ese est&aacute;ndar es importante. 
        Cuando llevar a cabo un est&aacute;ndar es importante para un individuo 
        eso compromete su autoestima. El fallo en la consecuci&oacute;n del nivel 
        deseado puede suponer verg&uuml;enza y ansiedad. En consonancia con lo 
        que la teor&iacute;a de la objetivaci&oacute;n plantea, las mujeres conmayor 
        insatisfacci&oacute;n corporal y con m&aacute;s miedo a ganar peso podr&iacute;an 
        tener m&aacute;s <em>interiorizado el ideal corporal</em> de la mujer 
        en la sociedad, y debido a esta mayor toma de autoconciencia corporal 
        se podr&iacute;a producir una evitaci&oacute;n de experiencias sexuales. 
        <br>
        &nbsp; Definici&oacute;n de alteraci&oacute;n de la imagen corporal. Encontramos 
        las primeras referencias en este campo a finales del siglo XIX. En 1903, 
        Janet se refiere a &#8220;la obsesi&oacute;n por la verg&uuml;enza del 
        propio cuerpo&#8221;. Bruch (1962) describ&iacute;a una alteraci&oacute;n 
        de la imagen corporal en las anor&eacute;xicas y la defin&iacute;a como 
        una desconexi&oacute;n entre la realidad de la forma y estado del cuerpo 
        de las anor&eacute;xicas y de c&oacute;mo ellas se ve&iacute;an, y concretamente 
        como una distorsi&oacute;n en la autopercepci&oacute;n del tama&ntilde;o 
        del cuerpo. Una alteraci&oacute;n cognitivo-afectiva hacia el cuerpo. 
        Que se manifiesta por la presencia de emociones o pensamientos negativos 
        por culpa de la apariencia f&iacute;sica. Algunos autores utilizan el 
        t&eacute;rmino &#8220;insatisfacci&oacute;n corporal&#8221; como la discrepancia 
        entre la figura que se considera actual y la que se considera ideal, elegidas 
        entre una serie de siluetas dibujadas, y otros, como la puntuaci&oacute;n 
        obtenida en una escala de nueve &iacute;tems referidos a diferentes partes 
        del cuerpo, junto a la satisfacci&oacute;n / insatisfacci&oacute;n que 
        suscitan y la presencia de juicios valorativos sobre el cuerpo que no 
        coinciden con las caracter&iacute;sticas reales. Los mensajes que hacen 
        referencia a la imagen corporal trasmiten la idea de que estar delgado 
        es el medio para obtener la felicidad y el &eacute;xito, siendo la moda 
        el principal factor ambiental involucrado en este tipo de trastorno. El 
        cuerpo delgado de las modelos es admirado por la mayor&iacute;a de las 
        adolescentes que en un intento por parecerse a ellas comienzan a hacer 
        dietas y a obsesionarse con su peso. <br>
        &nbsp; Estudios se&ntilde;alan que las estudiantes de danza presentan 
        un peso corporal m&aacute;s bajo y menos porcentaje de grasa que otras 
        estudiantes, asimismo se muestran m&aacute;s preocupadas por su alimentaci&oacute;n, 
        peso corporal y recurren al uso de laxantes para controlar su peso. La 
        motivaci&oacute;n para adelgazar indica que las estudiantes de danza con 
        trastorno alimentario presentan una gran preocupaci&oacute;n por la dieta 
        y por el peso corporal. La Insatisfacci&oacute;n corporal se&ntilde;ala 
        una inconformidad del cuerpo o bien de algunas partes de est&eacute;, 
        tales como la cintura, cadera o gl&uacute;teos. Sin embargo, la mayor&iacute;a 
        de las estudiantes de est&aacute; poblaci&oacute;n reportaron estar a 
        disgusto con su silueta e incluso con su peso corporal. Si bien las mujeres 
        se centran en la alimentaci&oacute;n para lograr un cuerpo delgado y como 
        estrategia complementaria utilizan la actividad f&iacute;sica, en cambio 
        en los hombres observamos que se centran en la actividad f&iacute;sica 
        para desarrollar masa muscular y como estrategia complementaria utilizan 
        la alimentaci&oacute;n. El ideal de un cuerpo muy musculoso, puede llegar 
        a ser tan peligroso para los hombres como lo es el ideal de extrema delgadez 
        para las mujeres. El perfeccionismo es una construcci&oacute;n te&oacute;rica. 
        Actualmente vivimos en una sociedad que prima en exceso la belleza y la 
        imagen. Cualquier art&iacute;culo que se anuncie en la televisi&oacute;n 
        es protagonizado por mujeres j&oacute;venes, bellas y delgadas. <br>
        &nbsp; <em>Ariadne von Schirach</em> (* 24 Juli 1978), &quot;Der Tanz 
        um die Lust&quot; (&quot;El baile en torno al placer&quot;): Creo que 
        el tema principal para nuestra generaci&oacute;n es la realizaci&oacute;n 
        personal. Y el amor y el sexo son una parte fundamental de esa realizaci&oacute;n. 
        Las personas de entre 25 y 35 a&ntilde;os pueden clasificarse en dos grandes 
        grupos: est&aacute;n los que salen, beben, festejan y toman drogas y aquellos 
        que no lo hacen. &iquest;Espontaneidad o pose provocadora? Es cierto que 
        mucho de lo que escribo y lo que digo es pol&eacute;mico, quiz&aacute;s 
        porque intento ser aut&eacute;ntica, suelto las cosas tal como las pienso. 
        <br>
        &nbsp; <em>La forza del destino</em>. El desarrollo de un nuevo r&eacute;gimen 
        de la visibilidad, a partir de las tecnolog&iacute;as digitales, ha incentivado 
        aquella necesidad primaria: el voyeurismo, en tanto pr&aacute;ctica que 
        busca satisfacer la libido a trav&eacute;s de la observaci&oacute;n de 
        lo genital o la imagen pornogr&aacute;fica, tiene su lugar como nunca 
        antes en la era digital. El antiguo fisg&oacute;n que disfrutaba de contemplar 
        el acto sexual ajeno, representado con la imagen cinematogr&aacute;fica 
        de la cerradura, se ha convertido en un sujeto absorbido por la pantalla, 
        como el propio sexo absorbe al mir&oacute;n: a distancia. Esa distancia 
        constituye la paradoja del sujeto-espectador de la posmodernidad: en su 
        af&aacute;n por espiar intimidades ajenas, ese sujeto -al propugnar el 
        aislamiento y la distancia- inmoviliza y excluye su propia intimidad. 
        De alguna manera, el hombre de la sociedad actual, devenido espectador 
        -porque ha dejado de ser part&iacute;cipe y actor de los acontecimientos 
        sociales- evidencia los mismos s&iacute;ntomas que el cl&aacute;sico voyeur 
        definido por los tratados de psiquiatr&iacute;a: un individuo que, con 
        tendencias adictivas, halla placer en el universo ajeno, sustituyendo 
        la acci&oacute;n por la mirada. La mirada, en esta era de la imagen, se 
        ha desarrollado m&aacute;s que ning&uacute;n otro sentido y, a partir 
        de ella, cualquier individuo que disfruta de escenas de erotismo podr&iacute;a 
        tener alg&uacute;n rasgo voyeurista. Pero, m&aacute;s all&aacute; de la 
        cuesti&oacute;n patol&oacute;gica, la era digital potenci&oacute; el consumo 
        de im&aacute;genes que muestran los efectos que producen en la sociedad 
        las pasiones humanas. En la era digital, la imagen ha pasado a ser productora 
        de realidades, lo que, de alguna manera, reemplaza en el hombre espectador 
        al referente externo. Hay una objetualizaci&oacute;n del Otro, que es 
        tomado para diversi&oacute;n y satisfacci&oacute;n del placer voyeur. 
        Es importante precisar que la palabra perversi&oacute;n no es peyorativa, 
        ni implica patolog&iacute;a. El padre del psicoan&aacute;lisis, Sigmund 
        Freud, destaca que estas pr&aacute;cticas integran la vida sexual del 
        hombre com&uacute;n. Poderosos toques de trompeta simbolizan el destino.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>En Fran&ccedil;ais: </strong> <br>
        &nbsp; Le regard des autres et perception du mouvement propre. Les psychologues 
        am&eacute;ricains Fredrickson et Roberts introduisaient la notion d'objectivation, 
        puis d' auto-objectivation du corps : le fait que les femmes adoptent 
        le regard &eacute;valuateur et critique de leur entourage sur leur propre 
        corps r&eacute;duit &agrave; la fonction d'objet. Le regard des autres 
        serait la source d'une anxi&eacute;t&eacute; permanente. La frustration 
        engendr&eacute;e par l'impossibilit&eacute; d'atteindre les canons de 
        la beaut&eacute; et le sentiment de ne pouvoir exister hors de ceux-ci 
        pr&eacute;parant alors le terrain &agrave; un &eacute;tat d&eacute;pressif. 
        Les chercheurs ont pass&eacute; cette perception du corps-objet au crible 
        des cinq traits sp&eacute;cifiques de la personnalit&eacute; d&eacute;finis 
        en psychologie. Il semble qu'un temp&eacute;rament plus masculin pr&eacute;serve 
        les femmes de ces exigences de <em>forme</em>. L'&eacute;nergie d&eacute;pens&eacute;e 
        &agrave; surveiller son apparence nuirait, &agrave; l'inverse, tant aux 
        performances intellectuelles qu'&agrave; la qualit&eacute; des relations 
        amicales et affectives. Les crit&egrave;res de f&eacute;minit&eacute; 
        impos&eacute;s par les m&eacute;dias semblent donc &agrave; l'origine 
        de troubles psychologiques r&eacute;els. Le cin&eacute;ma, les m&eacute;dias 
        ou la mode contribuent &agrave; la sexualisation pr&eacute;coce des filles. 
        Autrement dit, quand la valeur d'une personne se fonde exclusivement sur 
        son sex-appeal. Cette sexualisation des habits a commenc&eacute; il y 
        a vingt-cinq ans, avec la publicit&eacute; pour un jean Calvin Klein : 
        la jeune Brooke Shields, alors &acirc;g&eacute;e de 15 ans, y d&eacute;clarait 
        &laquo;il n'y a rien entre moi et mon jean&raquo;. <br>
        &nbsp; Les derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es du XXe si&egrave;cle accueillent 
        un v&eacute;ritable ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne <em>lingerie</em>. Les dessous 
        doivent s&eacute;duire, par leur beaut&eacute; mais aussi par leur efficacit&eacute; 
        sur la silhouette. Une autre raison guiderait ce retour des femmes vers 
        des dessous &eacute;rotiques, &agrave; savoir l'urgence du r&eacute;veil 
        du d&eacute;sir masculin confront&eacute; &agrave; la mont&eacute;e en 
        puissance des femmes dans le monde du pouvoir et l'existence de codes 
        de savoir-vivre. En m&ecirc;me temps, le temps des jeunes filles est venu. 
        <em>Les ann&eacute;es 90 B</em> rassurent ces inqui&egrave;tes qui peuvent 
        voir dans le succ&egrave;s grandissant du string et de la lingerie dite 
        <em>seconde peau, </em>l'affirmation d'une f&eacute;minit&eacute; sensuelle 
        et ind&eacute;pendante, d&eacute;fendue par des femmes de plus en plus 
        jeunes, s&ucirc;res de leur &eacute;l&eacute;gance, de leur confort et 
        de leur libert&eacute;. Cette libert&eacute; para&icirc;t aujourd'hui 
        acquise, en t&eacute;moignent les comportements actuels des adolescentes 
        qui s'exprimeraient dans des attitudes vari&eacute;es, nouvelle forme 
        de f&eacute;minit&eacute; complexe et multiple. Validant cette hypoth&egrave;se 
        de la f&eacute;minisation des adolescentes par une conscience du corps 
        et des apparences. <br>
        &nbsp; La qu&ecirc;te du d&eacute;sir dans les relations, cette reconnaissance 
        de la f&eacute;minit&eacute; dans la prostitution expliqueraient l'adoption 
        d'une lingerie raffin&eacute;e et la consommation, au d&eacute;but des 
        ann&eacute;es 1980, des dessous provocants. Les strat&eacute;gies de la 
        publicit&eacute; auraient vite fait de transformer ce qui &eacute;tait, 
        au mieux, une pose esth&eacute;tique en un acte de libert&eacute; et un 
        principe de s&eacute;duction. L'histoire des dessous raconte l'entr&eacute;e 
        des artifices de la femme l&eacute;g&egrave;re dans le foyer conjugal. 
        L'affirmation du corps qui traverse justement les deux derni&egrave;res 
        d&eacute;cennies du si&egrave;cle, n'entrave pas le d&eacute;veloppement 
        de la lingerie raffin&eacute;e, au contraire, celle-ci trouve des formes 
        &agrave; sa hauteur et rencontre un d&eacute;sir renouvel&eacute; de s&eacute;duction 
        de la part d'une client&egrave;le f&eacute;minine et masculine en qu&ecirc;te 
        d'une f&eacute;minit&eacute; plus &eacute;rotique. <br>
        &nbsp; <em>La mode </em>est l&agrave; pour faire r&ecirc;ver, cr&eacute;er 
        un univers d'exception, loin, dans un premier temps, des exigences de 
        la rue. Les dessins de mode n'ont jamais vraiment ressembl&eacute; &agrave; 
        une r&eacute;alit&eacute; terrienne. Les mannequins des d&eacute;fil&eacute;s 
        sont des filles sp&eacute;ciales. Une femme tr&egrave;s mince porte mieux 
        le v&ecirc;tement. Ce sont des corps exag&eacute;r&eacute;s qui correspondent 
        &agrave; la d&eacute;marche esth&eacute;tique actuelle de chercher toujours 
        plus d'extr&ecirc;me. Les collections sont charg&eacute;es, luxueuses, 
        les d&eacute;fil&eacute;s ont lieu dans des lieux gigantesques. Il faut 
        donc des corps disproportionn&eacute;s, des corps plus vraiment humains. 
        Le XXIe si&egrave;cle sera-t-il celui des corps transform&eacute;s? L'&eacute;poque 
        est au soft, au rond. Les v&ecirc;tements vont commencer &agrave; s'arrondir, 
        &agrave; prendre du volume. Les canons sont en train de changer. Un mod&egrave;le 
        un peu f&eacute;minin, un peu trash. &Ccedil;a donne de la libert&eacute;. 
        <br>
        &nbsp; L'Image et Le regard. Image: repr&eacute;sentation, m&eacute;taphore 
        ou id&eacute;e de la r&eacute;alit&eacute;. Il s'agit d'un terme complexe 
        dont les emplois varient dans l'histoire des th&eacute;ories artistiques 
        selon les &eacute;poques ou les orientations id&eacute;ologiques des diff&eacute;rentes 
        cultures. Les usages se rattachent &agrave; trois conceptions diff&eacute;rentes 
        de la notion d'image. Nous essayons d'en d&eacute;gager la th&eacute;orie 
        de l'image implicite dans le discours sur la repr&eacute;sentation. L'image 
        est elle-m&ecirc;me un discours que la pens&eacute;e, l'&laquo;imagination&raquo; 
        tient sur le monde. Elle est ainsi une interpr&eacute;tation du r&eacute;el. 
        Elle est aussi une &eacute;criture, dans la mesure o&ugrave; elle est 
        la trace d&#8217;une exp&eacute;rience cognitive, et o&ugrave; elle constitue 
        un langage permettant d&#8217;exprimer ce dont la pens&eacute;e discursive 
        et le discours rationnel savent mal rendre compte. L&#8217;image n&#8217;est 
        pas un objet, encore moins une chose en soi, elle est une relation fantasm&eacute;e 
        &agrave; un objet. Quand l&#8217;&eacute;nergie symbolique est particuli&egrave;rement 
        forte et quand elle se d&eacute;veloppe sous forme de r&eacute;cit, comme 
        dans une sorte de m&eacute;taphore fil&eacute;e, elle devient mythe. Toute 
        image est un codage de la r&eacute;alit&eacute;. Elle doit donc &ecirc;tre 
        d&eacute;cod&eacute;e par l'observateur. C'est donc une question de perception 
        et de r&eacute;ception. Le code s'exerce notamment dans le choix des &eacute;l&eacute;ments 
        caract&eacute;ristiques qui feront &laquo;appara&icirc;tre&raquo; la r&eacute;alit&eacute;. 
        <br>
        &nbsp; Dans le cas de la litt&eacute;rature, il est &eacute;vident que 
        l'image n'est pas de m&ecirc;me nature que la v&eacute;ritable image plastique. 
        L'Image, Catherine Robbe-Grillet / Jean de Berg. C'est la description, 
        aussi &eacute;vocatrice que possible qui permet &agrave; l'imagination 
        de se repr&eacute;senter mentalement l'id&eacute;e de l'objet. L&#8217;image 
        visuelle n&#8217;est ni la r&eacute;alit&eacute;, ni un calque de la r&eacute;alit&eacute;; 
        mais l&#8217;&eacute;vocation d&#8217;une r&eacute;alit&eacute; per&ccedil;ue, 
        une r&eacute;alit&eacute; reconstitu&eacute;e dans ses traits saillants 
        gr&acirc;ce &agrave; l&#8217;art de l&#8217;&eacute;crivain. La litt&eacute;rature 
        place le lecteur dans une disposition d&#8217;esprit, une posture qui 
        lui permet de &laquo;voir&raquo; mentalement l&#8217;objet repr&eacute;sent&eacute;, 
        pas de le voir physiquement mais de l&#8217;imaginer en faisant appel 
        &agrave; son exp&eacute;rience. L'image artistique ou po&eacute;tique 
        n'est pas seulement une reproduction, une imitation, une description de 
        la r&eacute;alit&eacute;, c'est <em>une exp&eacute;rience esth&eacute;tique</em>. 
        Toute la litt&eacute;rature est l&agrave; pour nous dire que l'image est 
        illusion. <br>
        &nbsp; L'Image. Subst. f&eacute;m. en fran&ccedil;ais, imagene vers 1050, 
        puis en moyen anglais par le fran&ccedil;ais, du latin imago, &laquo;imitation, 
        repr&eacute;sentation, forme ressemblante, portrait, tableau, statue, 
        masque, simulacre&raquo;. De la racine im- d'o&ugrave; imitor, et, avec 
        aspiration sifflante, sim d'o&ugrave; similis apparent&eacute;s morphologiquement 
        et s&eacute;mantiquement &agrave; image. <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp; Chez Hegel, <strong>le Zeitgeist</strong> est le &laquo;Geist&raquo; 
        immanent au &laquo;Zeit&raquo;, c'est-&agrave;-dire que &laquo;l'esprit 
        absolu&raquo; se manifeste comme Zeitgeist dans les ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes 
        de l'&eacute;poque. Le terme Zeitgeist gagne en profondeur et en unit&eacute;: 
        &laquo;Es ist nur ein Geist, ein Prinzip, welche sich im politischen Zustand 
        ebenso auspr&auml;gt, wie es sich in der Religion, Kunst, Sittlichkeit, 
        Geselligkeit, Handel und Industrie manifestiert&raquo; (Hegel, W. &eacute;d. 
        Hoffmeister I, 148). Les ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes d'une &eacute;poque 
        prennent tous leur source dans le Zeitgeist: &laquo;Es ist der eine substanzielle 
        Geist einer Periode, eines Volkes, einer Zeit, der sich aber auf vielfache 
        Weise gestaltet&raquo; (148; cf. 154f et 40). Ceci revient &agrave; dire 
        que &laquo;Aus dem Substanziellen seiner Zeit kommt niemend heraus, sowenig 
        wie aus seiner Haut&raquo; (149). (Cf. Th. Litt, Philosophie und Zeigeist, 
        Leipzig, 1935, pour l'interpr&eacute;tation de la structure dialectique 
        du Zeitgeist chez Hegel). <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp; A partir de 1830 environ, discr&eacute;dit&eacute;e par &laquo;l'historisme 
        activiste&raquo; (L&ouml;with) des h&eacute;g&eacute;liens de gauche, 
        la discussion philosophique autour du Zeitgeist pi&eacute;tine; le terme 
        perd son aspect &laquo;d&eacute;moniaque&raquo; et &laquo;m&eacute;taphysique&raquo;. 
        Jusqu'en 1883 (W. Dilthey, Einleitung in die Geisteswissenschaften), la 
        discussion philosophique se passa volontiers d'un terme comme Zeitgeist. 
        La red&eacute;couverte du Zeitgeist comme crit&egrave;re fondamental pour 
        la compr&eacute;hension des &eacute;v&eacute;nements historiques revient 
        &agrave; Dilthey. &laquo;In einem Zeitalter entwickeln sich allgemeine 
        Normen, Werte, Zwecke, in bezug auf welche zun&auml;chst die Bedeutung 
        der Handlungen aufzufassen ist&raquo; (G.S.; VII, 289). C'est seulement 
        dans ce sens, qu'on pourrait parler du Zeitgeist, du &laquo;Geist des 
        Mittelalters&raquo;, du &laquo;Geist der Aufkl&auml;rung&raquo; etc. parce 
        que chacune de ces &eacute;poques ne peut s'&eacute;lancer au-del&agrave; 
        du &laquo;Lebenshorizont&raquo; qui lui est propre. Dilthey d&eacute;finit: 
        &laquo;Ich verstehe darunter die Begrenzung, in welcher die Menschen einer 
        Zeit in bezug auf ihr Denken, F&uuml;hlen und Wollen leben...&raquo;.

        BHARATANATYAM =<br>
        BHAva (expression) + RAga (music) + TAla (rhythm) + NATYAM (dance):<br>
        <em>Lord Shiva</em> is the supreme lord of dance. The Dance is known as 
        <em>Tandava</em> and has vigourous, brisk movements. The tandava performed 
        with joy is called <em>Ananda Tandava</em>, and performed in violent mood 
        is called <em>Rudra Tandava. Anga Lakshana</em>, the way of moving body 
        parts. <em>Anga </em>means body parts and <em>shudhi</em>, means perfect. 
        Any dancer should try to achive this perfection. <BR>
