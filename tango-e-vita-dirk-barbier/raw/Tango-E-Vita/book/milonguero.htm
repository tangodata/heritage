            &nbsp; The roots of the close embrace-hold or &quot;Estilo Milonguero&quot;, 
            also called <a href="http://users.pandora.be/Tango-E-Vita/tangoiste/tangolessen/abrazo_movie.htm" title="Abrazo_Close_Embrace_Closeembrace" target="_blank">Apilado</a> 
            (from <em>apilar</em>: to pile up, tightly together / crowded), lies 
            in the liberal &#8216;twenties. The demografic male/female balance 
            was getting equal and as the First World War had changed the role 
            of women, dating became more easy. The opening of cabarets changed 
            gradually the image of tango criollo as a brotheldance. Dancing gained 
            popularity and by 1919 many dancehalls had opened. Both men and women 
            went to crowded tango clubs and confiter&iacute;as, where they danced 
            very close socialized, the woman&#8217;s head over her partner&#8217;s 
            right shoulder, so he could whisper in her ear and visa versa. The 
            Second World War redifined the gender roles even more. <br>
            <br>
            From '45, the Urquiza town became the breeding place for the Villa 
            Urquiza &quot;milonguero&quot;-style. It is related to Luis Lemos, 
            nicknamed &quot;Milonguita&quot;, who had an unique elegance and danced 
            like an angel, and Jos&egrave; Brahemcha, &quot;El Turco&quot;. Villa 
            Urquiza &quot;milonguero&quot; is an elegant and rhythmic style with 
            long steps, a firm position and using great, recognizable pauses. 
            <em>Carlos Gavito:</em> &quot; The secret of tango is in this moment 
            of improvisation that happens between step and step. It is to make 
            the impossible thing possible: to dance silence. This is essential 
            to learn in tangodance, the real dance, that of the silence, of following 
            the melody. The milongueros personify, incarnate that hidden treasure 
            of the tanguera dance, the representation of a Buenosairean- porte&ntilde;o 
            imaginary which belongs to another time, the conservation of codes 
            in extinction, a source of inexhaustible knowledge, wisdom and the 
            delicacy, subtility of an unique dance. <br>

            &quot;<strong><font color="#FF0000" size="5"> The secret of tango</font></strong> 
            is in this moment of improvisation that happens between step and step. 
            It is to make the impossible thing possible: <strong>to dance silence</strong> 
            &quot;, says <strong>Carlos Gavito</strong>, recognized milonguero 
            and Zen philosopher of the dance, who spent half of his life looking 
            for this moment of illumination in the dance, his choreographies astonished 
            people of the contemporary dance like Oscar Araiz. <br>
            - First, to dance it is to know how to listen to music. &quot;Nocturnal&quot; 
            is like listening to the street at night, it is incredible. All noises 
            must be dance. <br>
            &quot;<em>In the music are all the steps</em>. The low one, for example, 
            marks the walk of the man with all the problems of existence. There 
            is the violin, which sounds as the woman.. That's why, when one is 
            dancing and comes a very pretty part of violin has to say to the woman: 
            ' Dance me, dance me, bailame, bailame&acute;. Later the piano, that 
            is the moment at which both are walking together. Then there is a 
            comuni&oacute;n of movements. And <strong>El Bandone&oacute;n</strong>, 
            in which lives the spirit of tango Argentino. It is like a pomp of 
            soap and I get there in, inside. <em>The pomp moves inside with me, 
            but I do not move. </em><br>
            This is essential to learn in tangodance, the real dance, that of 
            the silence, of following the melody.<br>
            <br>
            Carlos Gavito: &quot; <em>The important thing is to know why we want 
            to dance. We dance a solitude that we have inside us and cannot occupy 
            with anything. This gap, that emptiness to which we put movement is 
            the tango.</em> &quot; <br>
            <BR>
            Till not long ago time, the milongueros were destined to die in the 
            anonymity of the dance. But the phenomenon of the tango in the whole 
            world transformed them into last decade into the figures looked by 
            prestigious artists as Pina Bauch, Carlos Saura, Sally Porter and 
            for ballet dancers dedicated as Miguel Angel Zotto, who inspired by 
            this dance de sal&oacute;n with style and elegance for his spectacles.<br>
            <br>
            The milongueros personify, incarnate that hidden treasure of the dance 
            tanguera, the representation of a Buenosairean- porte&ntilde;o imaginary 
            which belongs to another time, the conservation of codes in extinction, 
            a source of inexhaustible knowledge, wisdom and the delicacy, subtility 
            of an unique dance. Carlos Gavito y Puppy Castello they belong to 
            this race of dancers. <br>
            Popular in the milonguero world, Gavito and Castello they were summoned 
            to overturn their lessons in the project Ballet School of Argentine 
            Tango, that it will try to teach to the new generations the secrets 
            and the identity of that dancel, next to other milongueros outstanding 
            like the &quot;Pibe&quot; Avellaneda, the &quot;Gitano-Gypsy&quot; 
            Dom&iacute;nguez, the &quot;Turco-Turk&quot; Jose, Gerald Portalea 
            or &quot;Chino-Chinese&quot; the Perico, among others. <br>
            <br>
            Puppy Castello is the counterface of Gavito. His dance and his comments 
            are so sharp and definitive as the sheet of a razor. The milonguero 
            of Boulogne comes of an epoch in the one that was practised between 
            men and the important thing was to extract an own style. &quot; Now 
            the pibes dance all the equal ones. Notice that one: Par&aacute; pibe 
            that you are not traversing the group! &quot;, says Puppy Castello 
            to a young beginner who stands firm, frozen by the comment of the 
            teacher. <br>
            And wherefrom does his style come? <br>
            Of people like Gerardo Portalea, who does not have a great change 
            of steps, but it has an impressive cadenza. Better or worsened, my 
            style comes from these old men of Urquiza. Well paradito, armed good, 
            taking the compass. Not running, because now they dance you a Pugliese 
            and seem that they dance you a D'Arienzo. Earlier, in the contests, 
            at which they were looking for you was the compass and the elegance, 
            more than the steps. <strong>To walk is everything. </strong><br>
            <br>
            They are <strong>the last milongueros</strong>. Those that were hardened 
            in the clubs of Urquiza, Pompeya, Slaughter houses and Avellaneda; 
            those that know to walk the track and conserve the dance to the floor, 
            and those that were received in the academy of the street. Now they 
            are rescued of the negligence, for the Ballet School and for a documentary 
            that<strong> Bebe Kam&iacute;n</strong> is filming. <br>

            * The legendary dancer<strong> Carlos Gavito (&deg;1942), </strong> 
            passed away on the 1st of July 2005. He started his career as a tango 
            dancer in 1965 in Buenos Aires. He joined the cast <em>Forever Tango 
            </em>on December 1995, dancing and choreographing two classics of 
            the show &quot;S.V.P&quot; and &quot;A EVARISTO CARRIEGO&quot;, with 
            Marcela Duran. He was a true representative of the milonguero style, 
            very close up and passionate dance. <BR>
            <BR>
            &nbsp; <strong><font size="4">Perceptions of performances</font></strong> 
            are mostly seen from the point of view of the audience, reducing it 
            to the privileged senses which are sight and hearing, reducing the 
            act of dancing to its elegant and stylish <em>visual image</em>. Intensity 
            however, relates to all senses, they are all engaged during dancing. 
            All of them play a shining part. The silence of the close embrace 
            allows them to enter the relationship even more brightly. It becomes 
            a thing in itself. The key is body knowledge. In <em>communication</em>, 
            feelings are explored and experienced by the own body. If one knows 
            it, one can recognize it. <br>

            &nbsp; Visual channels only perceive visual phenomena, it is as making 
            a split between mind and body. Moreover, it is not always certain 
            that visual images are understood in terms of a real exchange between 
            the performer and the viewer. Movements have <em>symbolic</em> significances, 
            which have become choreographic and aesthetic components in their 
            own right, without necessarily referring directly back to their real 
            life sources. Maybe a visual design is attractive because one has 
            no idea what it means. So when an audience 'watches' a performance, 
            what is it looking at, exactly? <br>

            &nbsp; <strong>Is stage dance only an enlargement of the private dance 
            on the dancefloor ? </strong><br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; Stage dancers will tend to put appearance 
            above partner-connection, more on performing to an audience, 
            that is their <em>intention</em>. The focused intention of milongaclub 
            or social dancers will be primarily on their partners-connection
            and musicality. These subtle rhythmic 
            cadence movements are the pleasure of salondancing, but are no stage 
            spectacle for an audience at a distance. However, since 1955 is Argentine 
            tango also made for a stage performance with more fantasia, called 
            "Tango por enscenario". A crucial link regarding choreography and 
            the world of the milongas, is Antonio Todaro.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Antonio Todaro </strong>(1929-1994), innovator and milonguero, 
            was a very influential danceteacher. At the moment when the temptation 
            of the most intimate dance had become weak because lack of attraction, 
            Todaro caused a renewal for the conception of the stage tango. His 
            tango is strong, masculine, fast and powerful... not a slow, soft, 
            romantic. <strong>Estilo Todaro</strong> is the original dancehall 
            tangostyle in combination with stylistic choreographies. His style 
            alternates between the social dancing at the milongas and the professional 
            stage performances. <br>
            <br>
            Antonio Todaro had a special fondness for <em>dancing as follower</em> 
            and as an innovator, he had fun <em>expanding the follower's part</em>. 
            He is also famous for his skilled <em>Tango Doble Frente</em> / double 
            front (<strong>tango al reves</strong> - inversed/reversed) in which 
            the woman has her back to the man and the man embraces her around 
            the waist, so both dancers face the front/public, it is a very historical 
            style of tango invented by the popular milongueros of the <strong>1940</strong>s. 
            All steps that one dances in the regular, or &quot;derecho&quot; position, 
            can be danced al reves.<br>

            Todaro and Raul Bravo had a tango school for sixteen years in the 
            60's and 70's. Raul Bravo had a lengthy career as an exhibition tango 
            dancer in the 1960's when he toured the world with the Mariano Mores 
            orchestra, the<em> technique for dynamic powerful stage movement</em> 
            taught by Todaro is visible in the dancing of Raul Bravo. At the beginning 
            of the 90's, Miguel Angel Zotto and Milena Plebs led the first world 
            wide changes. When they reconstructed elements of the popular dancestyle 
            in their spectacle <em>Tango x 2,</em> they revealed the wealth of 
            the world of the milonga to eyes of the public. Then, the classes 
            of Antonio Todaro, with whom Zotto and Plebs had made their punctilious 
            stylistic work, began to fill with new customers.<br>
            <br>
            Today, Todaro's mark is world-famous and the roots of <em>Tango Nuevo 
            </em>are Todaro. It goes through his pupils Miguel Angel Zotto, Milena 
            Plebs, Roberto Herrera, Vanina Bisousand and others in the show <em>Tango 
            por dos</em>. Alejandra Mantinian and Gustavo Russo took likewise 
            instruction with him. Dancers of the today's generation (Gustavo Naveira, 
            Pablo Veron, Fabian Salas, Sebastian Arce and Chicho) are directly 
            or indirectly inspired by him.<br>

            &nbsp; <em>Another story</em>. Argentine tango, milonga and tangovals 
            are examples of irrational dancing, improvising creativity. This character 
            was changed dramatically in Paris in the 1930's, where the dance was 
            combined with the proud torso of the other ballroom dances, and given 
            a staccato action. It moved the visual emphasis to the torso and head, 
            which puts the bodycenter higher. This is a characteristic of dances 
            coming from Western Europe, and is a heritage of the origin of dancing 
            in the royal courts of Europe, like a symbol of higher education. 
            But in Argentine tango the body energy-center lies lower. A little 
            downwards pressure in the hips, makes the knees bend more and gives 
            a more centered body axes, a sneaking way of walking. This less royal 
            way of moving is related to knifefighting, 
            which is a fast, fluid and dangerous affair. To master this most lethal 
            of martial arts demands self-discipline, physical sacrifice and years 
            of intensive training. The experienced knife fighter will easily see 
            an opening and go in for the kill without being countered. <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; The socialclub dancer's skill is to know how to choose the 
            most effective move at the right moment, optimize the energy available 
            at that occurrence, as well as turn the hints offered by the partner 
            into an unique, unusual personal dialogue. The interactive 
            nature of pair dance gives lots of opportunity for partners 
            to subtly affect and kill each other. This means that there is a 3th 
            beat-pattern dimension. Underneath the "quick quick quick"-traspi&eacute;steps 
            and the living pulse of the music, grows a natural dialogue of rhythm 
            in the choreographic <em>couple's dance interaction</em>, which is 
            based on the opposition of characters, between what is inside you 
            and what is inside your partner. It's a face-to-face engagement. When 
            two people dance together, what they do affects each other in a profound 
            and ongoing way. A dialogue exposes, maybe something of a courtship 
            dance rhythm, the bottomline is chemistry. 
            <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; The more a dancer has a greater response variability, interactive 
            competence and higher sensitive attention towards the partner during 
            the interaction, making him or her feel exclusive in the game, the 
            more the whole body is involved in the rhythmic 
            structuring of tango. The level of indirectness, distance, 
            depends mostly on the amount of feedback one is getting from the partner. 
            In this, the woman has more fatale impact and control then the leading 
            man. The woman can activate a series of &#8220;body signals&#8221;, 
            bit by bit, like a soft laugh or singing, perhaps coming closer, which 
            ignite the curiosity of the man thus lightning him up, if she wants. 
            To be effective, the leader must also involve a degree of flexibility, 
            <em>improvising</em>, that of being able to harmonize and synchronize 
            with the partner. Every move is according to the partner&#8217;s response. 
            The main goal, the know why, is to build an intriguing bond with the 
            partner, reaching a genuine connection while dancing.<br>

            styles of Argentine tango, performance and milonguero, bring about 
            a controversy in the dance community. Some attribute a false dichotomy 
            between these styles. False because, in relity, they are complimentary. 
            In a certain aspect, performance tango or <em>Buehnentangos</em> and 
            milonguero tango are two sides of the same coin. <br>
            The Milonguero, or "close embrace" style is danced in the crowded 
            clubs of Buenos Aires. It evolved to compensate for large numbers 
            of couples dancing in limited space. The Milonguero style is a rich 
            and complex form of body signals and incorporates deep respect for 
            the music and its varied rhythms. The result is a form of Tango that 
            allows for simplicity of steps while encouraging a natural connection 
            between the dancers.&nbsp; <br>
            However, tango is known throughout the world because of performance 
            tango. The beauty and splendor of its figures are spread by TV and 
            on the stages of theaters across great distances to far away places. 
            In this tango the couple separates in order to execute complicated 
            figures and steps that have more visual appeal. The separate because 
            it would be difficult to see the &quot;closed&quot; tango in a large 
            theater of 500 or more people. The body work, particularly the leg 
            motions, would not engender great interest. In the performance tango 
            the steps are based on milonguero style, but are enlarged and embellished, 
            and become choreographies that cross the stage diagonally, creating 
            displays and making full use of the ample space available. The tango 
            is known throughout the world thanks to the artists, very fine and 
            expert dancers, and thanks to their inspiration and the hours of daily 
            work that they devoted to their talent. Thus, the tango was saved 
            from remaining an exotic popular dance of a remote country. The far 
            away Buenos Aires brought the heart of its culture near the heart 
            of the world. <br>
            However, the origin of tango was in the salon, where it still lives. 
            This tango relates to the passion which is awakened and grows within 
            the couple, including a specific manner of manipulating the space, 
            and a special combination of rhythmic beats. This is what the people 
            who come from other lands discover in Buenos Aires; another tango. 
            Then they understand that the true place of performance tango is on 
            the stag. This is why the best performance dancers always go to the 
            salon, to immerse themselves in its foundation, to invigorate their 
            choreographies and enrich them with the spontaneity of the salon. 
            After all, for the choreography to be thrilling and exciting,<em> 
            it must not appear to be rehearsed. Instead, it must translate the 
            spontaneity and heat of the salon.</em><br>
           
            In the salon the couple dances for their own enjoyment, and not for 
            show. The steps are a method to circulate within the space, which 
            is very limited. It is a &quot;closed&quot; tango, with erratic figures 
            that vary within the necessities imposed by the place. The milongueros 
            can dance on four tiles, one tile, or even in place, while preserving, 
            with great passion, the rhythm and contact with the other body, with 
            a mixture of relaxation and tension both physical and emotional. The 
            man offers his musical consciousness to the woman, and she follows 
            him as if she was his shirt. Her creativity flows through her interpretation 
            of the manner of enjoying in her body, and giving back what the man 
            proposes. <br>
            Anyway, this explanation is ineffable, and the emotion of the &quot;salon&quot; 
            is non-transferable. It's only verifiable with that wink that characterizes 
            all communities that share a passion a little secretively. The beauty 
            of this style is its simplicity, the great energy that flows on the 
            dance floor. The couples are as in a trance, in a kind of &quot;beyond 
            consciousness&quot;. The body language is extremely rich. The feelings 
            give meaning to the steps and to the movements of the bodies. <br>
            The vocabulary that this dancing elite communicates with permits a 
            view, a gaze at the meaning of this dance: &quot;to walk the tango&quot;. 
            &quot;apilarse&quot; 1, &quot;to sleep the woman&quot;, &quot;to move 
            her&quot;, &quot;to dance her&quot;. <br>
            The performance must have spectacularity, but it needs the &quot;salon&quot; 
            as inspiration because otherwise it would be showing something that 
            does not exist. The &quot;salon&quot; also needs the performance tango 
            to disseminate itself and transmit itself to other generation. But 
            even though everyone can dance &quot;salon&quot; not all of us can 
            dance &quot;performance&quot;. Sooner or later, anyone who intends 
            to will learn the &quot;salon&quot; tango, which is something feasible 
            and more near to the expectations of those who begin to take classes. 
            <br>
		The 
          people are a solitary community which seeks love, to love and be loved. 
          The embrace of the tango, la franela 2, the excitement it contains, 
          are an emulation of love, a relief for the soul and an act in which 
          the man and the woman tell each other without reservation their joy 
          and passion in an embrace.</font></p>

          Apilar means &quot;to stack&quot;. In this context it suggests to stack 
          the woman on the man, and the man on the woman. It refers to the leaning 
          posture used in this style of tango.</font></p>

          &quot;Franela&quot; is a Lunfardo term that has no word in English. 
          Literally it means &quot;flannel&quot;, but the Lunfardo meaning is 
          a subtle and sensual caress of the woman's body by the man's body. In 
          tango when the man rocks the woman in place, he enjoys the feeling of 
          her body against his. Also, a tight caminata, with the legsbrushing 
          together is franela. &quot;sleaze&quot; dancing has franela, but the 
          word &quot;sleaze&quot; might have a vulgar connotation not implied 
          with &quot;franela&quot;.</font></p>
        <p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 5"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><em><strong>Susana 
          Miller</strong> has probably put more people on the dance floors of 
          Buenos Aires' milongas than any other single teacher. In a 1999 article 
          in the Buenos Aires daily paper "Clarin," she was named one of the four 
          most important contemporary influences in tango. Susana is internationally 
          noted teacher of the Milonguero style of Tango.</em></font></p>
          <p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 5"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Milonguero 
            style is danced in <em>a close embrace that is not altered during 
            the dance</em>. You both have your weight over your feet and maintain 
            your own balance. There is body contact from the head to the waist 
            area. I don't agree that a woman has to lean on her partner in this 
            style. Perhaps some have come to this conclusion after observing men 
            with extra weight around the middle dancing with slender women who 
            need to change their body position to adjust to his shape. In order 
            for her to maintain a straight back, she needs to bring her feet away 
            from her partner and change the angle of her body position. But for 
            the majority of men I dance with in Buenos Aires, this is not necessary. 
            In fact, if you lean on some men, they may ask you to stand up and 
            dance on your own two feet rather than leaning forward on them. <br>
          It's important to relax when you dance. I admire the <em>wonderful calmness 
          </em>that milongueros have. Even on a crowded floor, they can move around 
          and use the space well. If there is a collision, they quietly pause 
          and wait for the space to continue without interruption. If a woman 
          has tension in her body, he will feel it. 
            <br>There 
          are three head positions for the lady: 1) your left cheek bone to his 
          right cheek bone (for salon style) 2) your right side of face to his 
          right side of face (for milonguero style) 3) your nose and forehead 
          to the right side of his face (alternate possibilty for milonguero style)
		 
            <br>
          Try these positions out with a partner and notice that you can stand 
          directly in front of your partner with your head in position #2. However, 
          in position #1, you may be in a V position with your body in relation 
          to his; more appropriate in salon style, but not in milonguero style.

          <P align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" arial,="arial," helvetica="helvetica">In 
            the spicy night life of Buenos Aires city center, <strong>the close 
            embrace</strong> that we foreigners have been less familiar with until 
            lately became popular. This helps to understand why it was frowned 
            upon in the neighborhoods where elegance implied a paper thin separation 
            of respect between gentleman and lady. Even so, it could be that there 
            were neighborhoods where the close style was preferred. <br>
            Exhibition tango was first developed within the warfare between different 
            neighborhood schools.</strong> For the most part it was danced as 
            a kind of loose warfare between different neighborhood schools, at 
            the social dances, in breaks between the social dancing. In the fifties, 
            Juan Carlos Copes led the development of tango for stage dancing, 
            which culminated in Tango Argentino and modern show dancing. With 
            this development, the tango style branched again, and the show dancers 
            quickly broadened and evolved their vocabularies creating even more 
            stylistic diversity. <br>
		
          In the modern epoch, after the return of democracy, stylistic differences 
          in social tango still loosely exist by geography. The best known style 
          is from the north and west, based on the style originally developed 
          in the Devoto neighborhood by Petroleos circle. More recently popular 
          among younger students is the close embrace style, danced mostly downtown. 
          And, while there are certainly other styles, these two styles dominate 
          the Argentine social scene of today. <br>
            <br>
		<b>So 
          finally we get to names.</b><br>
          This is not an easy subject, tango dance history being for the most 
          part an oral one; there have been many names. 
		  <br>
            <br>
            <b>Canyengue</b>, refers to the late twenties and thirties neighborhood 
            styles. Dancers tell of how the canyengue died out and the forties 
            social style tango took hold. Then tango actually had two divisions: 
            <b>Salon</b>, the walking dance, and <b>Orillero</b>, the one with 
            the turns. (Styles were also identifiable by orchestra allegiance). 
            Also, some dancers were known best for their <b>milongas</b>. In the 
            forties the word milonguero was not all that flattering, as it referred 
            to one who was addicted to the night life, never worked, and was often 
            begging for a loan. <br>
            However, in the modern epoch <b>Salon</b> and <b>Milonguero</b> have 
            become more interchangeable in describing the more vaguely defined 
            styles of a now older generation. They are now allied in being contrasted 
            to the <b>stage fantasy tangos</b>, inside and out of Argentina, and 
            foreign social dance forms. <br>
            Hence, dancers from each of these two major stylistic groups in Buenos 
            Aires today refer to what they do at their most elegant, i.e. when 
            walking the salon as opposed to showing off figures, as either Salon 
            or Milonguero. It is a matter of oral history. What words you use 
            to describe what depends on who you learned from first. But history 
            marches on, and the meaning of these words seems to be diverging again. 
            <br>
            The modern proponents of the style from the North West are all first 
            or second generation followers of the early group led by <b>Petroleo</b>. 
            This group includes the social dancers, <b>Fino</b> and <b>Miguel 
            Balmeceda</b> (passed on), and <b>Juan Bruno</b> and <b>Mingo Pugliese</b> 
            (living). The fantasy artists including <b>Todaro</b> and <b>Virulazo</b> 
            (both passed away), many performers still working from the <b>Copes</b> 
            generation and many important youngsters. They all seem to be most 
            comfortable calling the root of what they do <b>Salon Tango</b>, although 
            <b>Lampazo</b>, for example, still uses <b>Milonguero</b> to describe 
            this style, while <b>Juan Bruno</b> continues to insist on dividing 
            this style into <b>Salon</b> and <b>Orillero</b> styles. <br>
            Then along came <b>Pedro Rusconi, &quot;Tete&quot;</b> (the first 
            proponent of the close embrace to arise to prominence as a teacher) 
            and <b>Susana Miller</b>, who has coaxed several other milongueros 
            of this style to teach with her. They all would be comfortable with 
            <b>salon</b> as the label for their style, but most people in Buenos 
            Aires are calling it <b>milonguero</b> style. <br>
            So, for the most part, the salon and orillero styles of <b>Devoto</b> 
            have become combined into salon style tango. The closer embrace style, 
            which went untaught for longer, has taken milonguero style tango by 
            default. <br>
            Nobody yet is talking about the style of the south or of the neighborhoods 
            ringing the capital, where the younger Argentines often go on their 
            own spelunking expeditions. One thing that I am sure of is that these 
            neighborhoods offer fertile ground for further explorations in Buenos 
            Aires. <br>
            As for myself, while I have been attracted to all these distinct "styles" 
            of tango as I've seen them danced in Buenos Aires, I have not yet 
            formed personal preferences for any of them. I didn't even start noticing 
            close embrace, "Milonguero", style until I'd been in Buenos Aires 
            for a while. It took several years to get past being fascinated with 
            the steps, which were my first draw to the dance. The dancers who 
            were doing less footwork were uninteresting to me and I just didn't 
            see them. <br>
		<i>Then, 
          years of milonguero advice to feel the dance, not just learn steps began 
          to take effect. I started to notice the dancers for how they stood, 
          embraced and felt the music. It isn't like I didn't know about these 
          things before, I just didn't see them even though they were right in 
          front of me.</i> 
		  <br>
            <br>
		I 
          awakened when I saw Tete dance. </b><br>
            I watched him for two years without ever being able to steal a single 
            step or copy his style, but with great envy for his ability to express 
            the tango feeling, sensuality and music. He could do this with his 
            partner Maria, Mingo's wife Ester, who is a mistress of the other 
            style, and a plethora of young tango starlets. <br>
            Two years ago Tete began to teach, albeit with all the pedagogical 
            glitches of a beginner teacher, and I finally had a chance to get 
            into it. Here was a style that challenged from the inside out. <em>If 
            I couldn't make heart-to-heart contact I couldn't dance. </em> <br>
            As I made my first breakthroughs I started to gain a much deeper understanding 
            of what I call tango trance, that is the state in which one dances 
            a set at the milonga in a timeless space. Becoming one with the music 
            and my partner was no longer an abstract, intellectual concept to 
            be related somehow to my footwork. The music in its simplest syncopation, 
            came into focus as the basis for my connection with my partner. <br>
          After that experience in milonguero style my other tangos have also 
          improved. My "salon tango" is ever richer as I learn to stand tall and 
          make elegant my footwork and musicality. My "Orillero tango" keeps offering 
          more and more complexity and variation as I improve my strength, agility, 
          and concentration. It is also easier to try the vintage canyengue styles 
          and, several distinctive versions of milonga. Most importantly, I am 
          winning the sensual attention of the good dancers I partner.

            <strong><font color="#FF0000" size="5">CANYENGUE - danza canalla</font></strong> <br>
            <em>Sylvie Delisle y Boguslaw Dygasiewicz </em><br>
            <br>
		  Seg&uacute;n Martha Ant&oacute;n y Luis Grondona,  bailarines y profesores de tango de Buenos Aires, el canyengue &quot;Es la  esencie pura de los principios del tango. Sus or&iacute;genes se remontan al 1900. Su  significado en afro es &quot;caminar cadencioso&quot;. El canyengue contiene el  abrazo de origen. Su andar es suave, picaresco, sensual y divertido. Sus  movimientos son cortados, corresponden a los compases del 4 x 8 y, con el pasar  de los anos se transformaron en el tango actual del 2 x 4&quot;.
		  <br>
            <br>
			Pero, como todo que se refiere al  tango, hay otras explicaciones al respecto de la palabra &quot;canyengue&quot;.  Seg&uacute;n Jos&eacute; Gobello (autor de los libros sobre el tango) la palabra viene de los  africanismos: &quot;candombe&quot; y &quot;yongo&quot;. Juntas, esas dos  palabras forman &quot;canyongo&quot; para convertirse, por las transformaciones  ling&uuml;&iacute;sticas, al &quot;canyengue&quot;.

Un otro autor, Eduardo Stilman,  cree que esa palabra significa &quot;menoscabado&quot;, &quot;perezoso&quot; en  dialecto de los esclavos negros que llegaron en la regi&oacute;n del Rio de la Plata.
<br>
Roberto Laguardia  Trias va tambi&eacute;n en ese mismo sentido afirmando que &quot;canyengue&quot; viene  de la palabra &quot;ngengue&quot;, la cual, en una lengua africana, significa  &quot;in&uacute;til&quot; (sin valor). Y, despu&eacute;s de a&ntilde;adir del prefijo &quot;ka&quot;  y una peque&ntilde;a modificaci&oacute;n, llegamos a la palabra &quot;canyengue&quot;.

<br>
Podemos agregar m&aacute;s significaciones  confirmando as&iacute; los or&iacute;genes plebeyos de la palabra &quot;canyengue&quot; y,  por ese hecho, del tango mismo. Y la lista es bastante larga. Aqu&iacute; tenemos  unas: &quot;canalla&quot;, &quot;arrabalero&quot;, de baja condici&oacute;n social.  Tambi&eacute;n: &quot;deteriorado&quot;, &quot;estropeado&quot;,  &quot;descangayado&quot;. Como podemos deducir, en los principios del siglo XX,  el canyengue era sin&oacute;nimo de alguien marginal que viv&iacute;a en los barrios pobres,  los arrabales. Hasta hoy mismo, esa percepci&oacute;n no ha desaparecido  completamente. Un amigo, bailar&iacute;n profesional argentino, me ha dicho que &eacute;l  baila el canyengue para bromear y para burlarse. Y &eacute;l no &eacute;sta solo en su punto  de vista.

<br>
Como se sabe, el tango naci&oacute; en los  conventillos de los barrios populares de Montevideo y Buenos Aires; en los  arrabales, en los salas de baile de baja condici&oacute;n y en los bares de mala fama,  en los burdeles y en la calle. Entonces, no nos sorprende que, en los  principios, el tango no era apreciado, pero al contrario, denegado por la  &quot;buena sociedad&quot;. Pues, seg&uacute;n esa clase, el tango era un baile para  la plebe, para el populacho, para prostitutas y malevos. Solamente, despu&eacute;s su  pasaje triunfal, hacia los a&ntilde;os 1907-1914, por las capitales europeas, que los  salones de Buenos Aires y Montevideo hab&iacute;an empezado a acostumbrarse al tango.  Sin embargo, los clientes de los salones rechazaban de bailarlo en la misma  manera que la clase popular. Entonces, el baile &quot;canalla&quot; se hizo m&aacute;s  pulido, m&aacute;s elegante. Y el sombrero de compadrito fue sustituido por la  chistera de &quot;Monsieur&quot;, vestido de frac, acompa&ntilde;ado de una copa de  &quot;champagne&quot;. El baile de la clase popular ha invadido los salones, convirti&eacute;ndose  en &quot;tango-sal&oacute;n&quot;. La &quot;buena sociedad&quot; ha limpiado el tango  de su aspecto canalla, bail&aacute;ndolo sin cortes y quebradas. Los viejos tangos  fueron despojados de su ritmo &quot;canalla&quot;. Despu&eacute;s de todos esos  afinamientos el tango fue m&aacute;s aceptable para los salones.
<br> 
<br>
            <strong>El canyengue </strong>- es la manera de bailar, pero tambi&eacute;n 
            - la manera de tocar la m&uacute;sica, que consiste de golpear las 
            cuerdas del instrumento con arco y la mano. Esa manera ha sido inventada 
            por el contrabajista de la orquesta de Roberto Firpo, Leopoldo Thompson. 
            Y en los varios tangos tocados por esa orquesta se puede distinguir 
            esas fiorituras. Tambi&eacute;n se puede encontrarlos en las interpretaciones 
            de algunas otras orquestas, como por ejemplo: Julio De Caro, Osvaldo 
            Fresedo, Juan Bautista Guido, Francisco Canaro, Edgardo Donato... 
            La m&uacute;sica tiene el ritmo sostenido, regular y bien pronunciado. 
            Las frases musicales son, generalmente, bien definidas y se prestan 
            perfectamente a la ejecuci&oacute;n de diferentes pasos. Los bailarines 
            se tienen bien &quot;pegados&quot;, uno al otro. El principio del 
            tango que dice que dos personas hacen una, es a&uacute;n m&aacute;s 
            verdadero en el canyengue; los dos cuerpos, salvo excepciones, no 
            se separan. Las orillas de los bailarines est&aacute;n plegadas (lo 
            m&aacute;s bajo posible), la mujer se inclina hacia el hombre y se 
            apoya sobre &eacute;l, pero sin colgarse sobre su cuello. Gracias 
            a esa postura los pies est&aacute;n alejados y los bailarines forman 
            una especie de pir&aacute;mide. El baile est&aacute; compuesto de 
            los pasos relativamente simples, habitualmente cortos, repetitivos, 
            bien definidos, regulares y r&iacute;tmicos. En esa manera de abrazarse 
            y de bailar se puede adivinar los or&iacute;genes picarescos del tango. 
            S&iacute;, tenemos que admitirlo que la manera de bailar el canyengue 
            no es muy elegante, pero es tunante, especial y divertida. Como se 
            puede ver, su manera de bailar se distingue de los otros estilos (tango-sal&oacute;n, 
            milonguero o tango-espect&aacute;culo) por su postura, su abrazo y 
            su manera de caminar. Es un estilo bien particular quien necesita 
            un cierto esfuerzo f&iacute;sico (ante todo en los principios del 
            aprendizaje) por el hecho que las piernas est&aacute;n plegadas y 
            que hay una contorsi&oacute;n de los cuerpos de los bailarines, especialmente 
            de la mujer. <br>
