            <br>
            &nbsp; As Argentine tango was originally an erotic dance that could 
            only be danced in a bordello and only prostitutes were involved, the 
            role of women in tango was spontaneously related to the brothel and 
            a lower social class setting. For an acceptable woman, to dance tango 
            was out of the question. Later, tango became related to a more esthetic 
            social context and became a very much acceptable lifestyle. Tango's 
            sensuality however, is still overshadowed by our contemporary ambiguity. 
            <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; In today's science of sexy reframing, things are looking sexier 
            than ever. Dita Von Teese, perhaps the most famous burlesque dancer 
            in the world, included garter belts, panties, and bras in her collection 
            (with an unsurprising nod to retro fashions). The Wonderbra-star says 
            of her saucy drop-dead sexy styles:<br>
            <br>
            &#8220;Lingerie shouldn&#8217;t be something you just put on for your 
            lover; you should do it for you&#8230;It&#8217;s not about seducing 
            men, it&#8217;s about embracing womanhood.&#8221; <br>

            &nbsp; There are two basic kinds of reframes: context reframing and 
            content reframing. Content reframing is changing the meaning of a 
            situation, or you can reframe the situation into another context...

            <strong><font color="#CCCCCC" size="4">Egypt </font></strong> <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; <strong>Oriental Belly Dance</strong> - Although there is a 
            big cultural difference between Buenos Aires and Cairo, Argentina 
            and Egypt, similarities can be noticed in the public opinion and the 
            authorities attitude towards a woman's dancing. <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; In the beginning, the Oriental belly dance was a social dance 
            inside the closed house between women, at family festivals like weddings, 
            thus not intented as a seduction dance, perhaps fulfilling a ritual 
            or spiritual function, an act of happiness. Dance was just something 
            people spontaneously did. <br>
            <br>
            Yet, the perception of the act of dancing changes when the situation 
            gets mixed with the opposite sex. In that context it's a tool for 
            seduction, a titillating performance for non-family men or an act 
            of provocation when obvious foreigners are involved, human exposure 
            as a type of paid entertainment in a public setting. The frame is 
            changed. <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; But the dancing is in this not the crucial thing, it is the 
            attractive woman. If a man is performing the dance, it will not bewitch 
            the audience so intense, there will be no general arousal of the public 
            mind and the dancer will not get a bad reputation, he does not embodies 
            the fantasies of society as it is. These fantasies are a source of 
            income and create employment opportunities. It's a drive behind entertainment, 
            enlarging the exotic appeal of the dance shows and making the spectacle 
            more delirious. <br>
            <br>

            malgr&eacute; leur jeunesse, <br>
            une exp&eacute;rience et un professionnalisme de premier ordre. Elles

            Raja Amari's movie <strong>Satin Rouge</strong> touches in a subtle 
            way the ambiguity of acting out reality in front of viewers. As the 
            performing arts uses the artist's own body as a medium, the exhibit 
            can also be called entertainment or a misconduct. Bodily postures 
            express, reinforce and challenge inner attitudes and the audience 
            features as a participant. <br>

            <br>
            &nbsp; <strong>Danz&oacute;n</strong> - Julia Solorzano (Mar&iacute;a 
            Rojo) is a middle-aged single mother who works as a telephone receptionist. 
            She shares supportive friendships with her female colleagues with 
            whom she frequents dance halls. It is clear that dancing is the highlight 
            of her life. She relishes the strict codes of conduct prescribed by 
            the danz&oacute;n (popular dance hall), and in particular the formal 
            respect with which her regular dance partner Carmelo (Daniel Regis) 
            treats her. Carmelo is fiftyish, always immaculately dressed in a 
            chic white suit and hat. Oddly (or not so oddly if you think that 
            the realistic &quot;Danzon&quot; has discreet elements of fantasy 
            and symbolism), Julia knows next to nothing about Carmelo, whom she 
            meets only at the dance hall. &quot;He's married, all men are married&quot; 
            says a friend, but Julia discounts this. When invited to dance by 
            a young man, she refuses him, commenting to her friend Silvia that 
            a woman should never dance with a younger partner. When Carmelo doesn't 
            appear for three consecutive dance meetings, Julia becomes worried 
            and, suspecting he may have returned to Veracruz, his city of origin, 
            travels there to find him. <br>
            <br>
            Julia quickly befriends a transvestite Suzy (Tito Vasconcelos) and 
            a group of prostitutes who help her in her quest to find Carmelo. 
            Suzy encourages Julia to emphasize her femininity in her self-presentation, 
            with a brighter wardrobe, jewelry and make up. Julia, donning high 
            heels and red lipstick, is simultaneously more vulnerable to a threatening, 
            unwelcome male gaze and a pleasant sexually charged male encounter. 
            Dressed for the first time in her new attire, she is both harassed 
            by intrusive workmen and approached by an attractive young man with 
            whom she will have an enjoyable fling. She is now free to act outside 
            the conventions prohibiting a woman from dancing with a younger man. 
            <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; <strong>Danz&oacute;n</strong> (M&eacute;xico, 1991) was directed 
            by Mar&iacute;a Novaro (1951), Mexico's most important feminist moviemaker. 
            The film deals with the attempts of a middle-class working woman and 
            single mother to survive in Mexico City, which she does in large measure 
            through her commitment to escaping into the world of ballroom dancing. 
            In the mid '70s, Mar&iacute;a Novaro studied Sociology at the National 
            Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) during which time she participated 
            in a feminist filmmaking collective as consultant on the production 
            of various documentaries. Novaro's most valuable contribution is to 
            have definitively rescued the protagonist Mexicana from earlier simplistic 
            and stifling stereotyping such as suffering mothers and fallen 'malas 
            mujeres' (bad women). <br>
            Novaro herself, whilst clarifying that she does not want to be associated 
            with, nor limited by, any one ideological stance, has stated that 
            she considers herself to be feminist in her personal life but not 
            in her work. The high profile lead actress of Danz&oacute;n, and subsequent 
            Mexican congresswoman, Mar&iacute;a Rojo, does however consider herself, 
            her work in Danz&oacute;n and the film itself to be feminist. <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; The story goes that tango started in the brothel, moved to 
            Paris and then became an acceptable dance. Changed the social conduct 
            codes or was tango redefined? Was it given a new, maybe ambivalent 
            substance?<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; They say that in the begining, tango was danced between men, 
            in the corners of any red-light district of Buenos Aires, in the patios 
            of the old conventillos or in the old slaughter houses (mataderos). 
            At that time, the tango with women was only danced in the brothels 
            or in the houses with &quot;easy life&quot; girls known as<em> las 
            casas de las chicas de vida ligera</em>. Argentineans say that respectable 
            women could not dance tango because it was a prohibited, it was a 
            <em>prostibularia</em> dance,<em> una danza prohibida</em>. For them 
            the tango did not exist. Since Argentine tango was originally an erotic 
            dance that could only be danced in a bordello and only prostitutes 
            were involved, the role of women in tango was spontaneously related 
            to the brothel and a lower social class setting. For an acceptable 
            woman, to dance tango was out of the question. Later, tango became 
            related to a more esthetic social context and became acceptable. Tango's 
            erotic origin however, is still a delicate matter, it is still characterized 
            by a mixture of opposite feelings and attitudes.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; Especially in tangoshows, dance involves taking on a role, 
            revealing a character and playing a play, like enacting the power 
            of the prostitute metaphor which is in stark contrast to the ideal 
            of marriage. The prostitute metaphor is first applied in the Hebrew 
            Testament. The marriage and prostitute metaphors continue in the New 
            Testament. The prostitute was seen as having magical powers. She seduced 
            men and lured them with her wiles &#8211; through the clothing she 
            wore, through her physical and social charms, and through her cosmetics 
            and perfumes. The dance of sexual interplay between man and prostitute 
            was also marked by tolerance of violence toward the prostitute. The 
            sexuality of the prostitute embodies the evil nature of female sexuality, 
            and a woman's potential to hold a disturbing power over a man in the 
            sexual realm. The prostitute was viewed as a temptress, who lured 
            men through their carnal desires. It seems that in it, some aggression 
            is concealed. That image of tango very much alive on TV dance shows, 
            and the number of reality dance competitions keeps increasing. These

            &nbsp; It is obvious that Argentine tango is a sensual dance, but 
            what is sensual? Is it the same as sexy? Or sensitive? <BR>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; According to the dictionary, <EM>sensual</EM> is relating 
            to or affecting any of the senses or a sense organ; sensory. Sensuous: 
            highly appreciative of the pleasures of sensation. Sensual is all 
            that reports to a sense, all and everyone existing in human life. 
            Sensuality, also sensualness, means all that reports to any forms 
            of sense one that can recognize, say, “sense” it. <BR>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Sensualism</em> relates to the search for beauty, 
            amazing beauty, and the cruelty and pain that often accompanies that 
            beauty. In tango, Borges refers to the beauty of the panther, the 
            leopard or jaguar. Cruelty is a part of the beauty. <BR>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Sensuality </em>refers to subtle, <em>interior</em> 
            sensations. Such as, a tattooer who falls in love with a girl after 
            just seeing her foot, as in Junichiro Tanizaki’s story, "Shisei" (<EM>Sisei, 
            Si-Sei, The Tattooer, Tattoo, Irezumi</EM>). Much "sensuality" can 
            be found in Japanese literature: Yukio Mishima, Yasunari Kawabata, 
            Baku Akae. <BR>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; <EM>Sexyness</EM>, sexiness, sex appeal or being sexy 
            is about an <em>exterior</em> appearance. It can be related to self-perception, 
            self-awareness, self consciousness, ego. A feeling of self-consciousness 
            occurs when we realize that we are being watched or observed, the 
            feeling that "everyone is looking" at us. When feeling self-conscious, 
            one becomes aware of even the smallest of one's own actions, self-objectification. 
            Much of human sexual attractiveness is governed by physical attractiveness 
            which <em>Ariadne von Schirach</em> calls &quot;Der Tanz um die Lust&quot;, 
            wrapped up in desirability. Attractiveness involves the impact one's 
            appearance has on the senses, especially in the beginning of a relationship: 
            Visual perception (how the other looks). Audition (how the other's 
            voice sounds). Olfaction (how the other smells, naturally or artificially; 
            the wrong smell may be repulsive). Olfactory signals, or smell, can 
            influence the perception of attractiveness. Physical attractiveness 
            is the perception of the physical traits of an individual human person 
            or a group, race, or type of people, as attractive or beautiful. <BR>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Sensitivity</em>, sensitiveness, sensible, sensibility: 
            mental responsiveness and awareness, refined sensitivity to pleasurable 
            or painful impressions. <em>Sensibility</em> seems to have a particular 
            literary sense, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. It refers 
            to a cluster of attributes, amongst which you can include the display 
            of &quot;elegant and graceful&quot; emotions and tastes, exhibiting 
            a careful attention to detail, etiquette. Hard to please, demanding.

            Gay tango has changed the typical tango scenery. Since gay couples 
            were granted marriage-like status, Buenos Aires has suddenly become 
            the gay mecca of South America, rivalling Rio de Janeiro as the traditional 
            destination for gay tourists from the United States and Europe. Neighbourhoods 
            like fashionable Palermo and Recoleta, are known for being safe and 
            accepting places for gays and lesbians. Gay men and women can dance 
            without drawing uncomfortable stares. <br>

            &nbsp; One can say that Gay tango has changed the typical macho image 
            of tango. Yet, the image of the male dancer has always carried machismo 
            stereotyping. And, in tango men often dance together. Men invented 
            the tango dance technique, including the female part. In fact, a tanguero 
            has to know the follower's movements from inside out to be capable 
            to guide tanguera - o. A reference is <strong>Antonio Todaro</strong>. 
            He had a special fondness for dancing as follower and as an innovator, 
            he had fun expanding the follower's part. He is also famous for his 
            skilled Tango Doble Frente / double front (tango al reves - inversed/reversed) 
            in which the woman has her back to the man and the man embraces her 
            around the waist, so both dancers face the front/public, it is a very 
            historical style of tango invented by the popular milongueros of the 
            1940s. All steps that one dances in the regular, or &quot;derecho&quot; 
            position, can be danced al reves. Men created ballet too, yet dancing 
            is now seen as a female art in which masculine dancers assist the 
            women. Men's contemporary role seems to be more directed into guiding 
            the woman. <br>

            &nbsp; Dance houses or milongas are very respectable, having strict 
            rules called etiquette, ment to create an artificial mis-en-scene. 
            Mise en scène means literally "putting into the scene" or "setting 
            in scene." In the<em> boliches de tango</em>, single men are sitting 
            on one side, single women on the other and couples in the back. You 
            make eye contact with a partner and get up as the music starts. It 
            is the beginning of a <em>tanda</em>, a set of 4 or 5 similar tangos, 
            milongas or valses. During the first number, streams of people fill 
            the dancefloor. Guiding means moving and keeping the woman at the 
            outside of the dancefloor, to the tables, as near as possible to the 
            sitting public. So she has some space to move and gets no feet kicks. 
            An unaware dancer gets driven in the center, gets stuck. When the 
            first number of the tanda stops, one is supposed to stand still and 
            talk. Social dance is a danceform where<em> sociability and socializing 
            </em>are the primary focuses of the dancing. On the dance floor, peculiarly 
            the conversation piece is important. At the end of a tanda, the sound 
            of the cortina comes like a bel. Now, the floor must be empty to make 
            new eye contact possible. The act of watching is omnipresent.<br>

            &nbsp; Europeans who go to Buenos Aires to dance the &quot;passionate 
            tango&quot; in the milongas, may find the formal codes and behavior 
            rules, such as the strict separation between men, women and couples, 
            a bit outdated. Others will find it nostalgic, as if concealing mystic 
            darkness, as in the old days of Catholicism. A history of social dance 
            is a history of morality and as 83% of the Argentinians are Catholics, 
            the setting reflects some Catholic morality. <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; For a single Catholic woman it isn&#8217;t always easy to make 
            the step to tango dancing, tango with it's, nearly sacramental, intimacy 
            and passion. But, quite true, dance portrays the beauty of the person 
            as made in the image of God. <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; The English word whore, referring to (female) prostitutes, 
            is taken from the Old English word hora (from the Indo-European root 
            ka meaning &quot;to like, desire&quot;) but usage of that word is 
            widely considered pejorative and prostitute is a less value-laden 
            term. It could also come from the Islamic term houri, the name for 
            an attentive female virgin in the afterlife, but this derivation is 
            unlikely given the presence of cognates of the Old English word in 
            other Germanic languages. On the other hand, in Germany most prostitutes' 
            organizations deliberately use the word Hure (whore) since they feel 
            that prostitute is an unnecessary euphemism for something not in need 
            of euphemisms. The term sex worker is becoming the label of choice 
            in Australia. Prostitutes may also be called hookers.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; In Hebrew the meaning of the word<em> fornication</em> is &quot;broader&quot; 
            than <em>adultery</em>. To<em> fornicate</em> or to play the whore, 
            becomes virtually synonymous with engagement in <em>idolatry, the 
            worship of idols, images </em>that are not God. No metaphor, especially 
            as it symbolizes the practice of idolatry, is more powerful than the 
            woman as whore, in all of the captivating sexual imagery it symbolized. 
            <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; <em>Innocence</em>. In contrast to ignorance, innocence is 
            generally viewed as a positive term, connoting a blissfully positive 
            view of the world, in particular one where the lack of knowledge stems 
            from a lack of wrongdoing, whereas greater knowledge comes from doing 
            wrong. This connotation may be connected with a popular false etymology 
            explaining &quot;innocent&quot; as meaning &quot;not knowing&quot; 
            (Latin noscere). Children are usually considered to be innocent and 
            to gradually lose this attribute through maturity by gaining knowledge 
            of the adult world. This view is common in regards to sexuality, though 
            seeing that as a wrong thing is a disputed idea, which some argue 
            stem from Christianity and other religion's classification. Around 
            the enlightenment period of the eighteenth century, the conceptions 
            of childhood changed. Society adopted the idea of the &quot;blank 
            slate&quot; and beginning life in a state of unconsciousness. <br>

            &nbsp; Like industrialization, the history of prostitution in Argentina 
            offers sobering insights, in fact &quot;el comercio carnal&quot; has 
            been legal in Argentina since the beginning of republic. Prostitution 
            laws were the first type of labor legislation enacted, even before 
            the basic legal codes of the country were formed. The governing officials 
            viewed prostituci&oacute;n as a danger to the Argentine national identity 
            with the potential to destroy not only the family but also the medical 
            health of the country. It was for this reason that laws were enacted 
            which legalized prostitution but forced the commercial sex workers 
            to live in special burdeles-houses, undergo supervised medical examination 
            and have their inheritance and business rights restricted.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; Why did so many girls turn to this quecos-business? Prostitution 
            was a response to poverty because of the hunger, religious and political 
            persecution that many European Franchucha had faced in their former 
            homelands, and upon arriving in Buenos Aires, this was a reasonable 
            trade to make for the freedom from poverty they had endured in prior 
            realities. The by human traffic imported "Esclavas Blancas" served 
            a dual economic function, one for their sexual and dancing skills, 
            and second for stimulating their customers to drink alcohol, champagne. 
            <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; Today, the same pattern is repeating. Women are brought to 
            Buenos Aires by a pimp, always with the same behavior method: the 
            women are deceived with the promise of a legal work; in the destination 
            place their documents are snatched and are confined to live under 
            the rules of rape, punishments and abuse of drugs. Prostitution as 
            part of the organized crime at a world-wide level has in Argentina 
            heartbreaking examples. <br>

            <strong><font color="#CCCCCC" size="4">On Morality &amp; Aesthetics</font></strong> 
            <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; Moral codes are often complex statements of right and wrong. 
            Although some people might think that the moral code is simple, rarely 
            there is anything simple about one's morals or ethics or for that 
            matter judgment of others' morals. The difficulty lies in the fact 
            that <em>morals are often part of a religion </em>and more often than 
            not about culture codes. The term <strong>Morality</strong> is often 
            used to refer to a system of principles and judgments shared by cultural, 
            religious, and philosophical concepts and beliefs, by which humans 
            subjectively determine whether given actions are right or wrong. These 
            concepts and beliefs are often generalized and codified by a culture 
            or group, and thus serve to regulate the behavior of its members. 
            Conformity to such codification may also be called morality, and the 
            group may depend on widespread conformity to such codes for its continued 
            existence. In any society there is a divergence between the notion 
            of how we ought to behave and the reality of how we behave, so there 
            is a difference between hypothetical punditry and real morality. <em>Meta-ethics</em> 
            asks strange questions such as: Do the terms &quot;straight&quot;, 
            &quot;gay&quot;, &quot;fuck&quot;, and &quot;slut&quot; make sense? 
            How do we justify the existence of <em>good</em>, or is it all relative 
            and is morality simply a statement of one's preferences ?<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; The word <strong>Aesthetics</strong> however, was not widely 
            used until the beginning of the 19th Century. Its use comes from the 
            German <em>&auml;sthetisch</em> or French <em>esth&eacute;tique</em>, 
            (both from the Greek meaning a perceiver or sensitive). It meant &quot;the 
            science which treats of the conditions of sensuous perception&quot;. 
            When aesthetics was established as a field of study by German philosophers 
            in the 18th century, the emphasis was on beauty, taste, transcendance 
            and the sublime. Aesthetically appealing objects were beautiful in 
            and of themselves. The meaning of aesthetic as an adjective may be 
            illuminated by comparing it to anaesthetic. If something is anaesthetic, 
            it tends to dull the senses or cause sleepiness. Aesthetic may be 
            thought of as anything that spontaneous tends to stimulate the senses, 
            <strong>that which appeals to the senses</strong>. <br>

            <br>
            &nbsp; After the 1976-1983 dictatorship, democracy was restored and 
            people became aware of the importance of being respectful about human 
            rights and being tolerant toward different ideas, ideologies, sexual 
            orientation, and ethnic and racial differences. <br>
            The Argentina Homosexual Community, the country's first gay-rights 
            organization, was created in 1984. In 2002, a turning point for stereotypical 
            sex roles in Argentina, the city became the first in Latin America 
            to pass a civil union law, giving gays and lesbians most of the rights 
            enjoyed by married couples. <br>

            &nbsp; Buenos Aires is viewed as one of the most progressive cities 
            in South America. The city is in the midst of a tourism boom since 
            the Argentine peso lost two-thirds of its value shortly after the 
            country's 2001 economic collapse. More than 6.5 million tourists visited 
            Buenos Aires in the first 11 months of 2003, a 38-per-cent increase 
            over the same period in 2002. An added attraction for all visitors 
            is the legendary good looks of Argentinians. Small wonder that the 
            sex tourism industry for both heterosexuals and gays is booming, fuelled 
            by demand from an increasing number of tourists and an economic depression 
            that has induced many young people to work in escort agencies. The 
            number of escort agencies is growing, and many students from the interior 
            of the country are financing their studies in Buenos Aires this way.<br>

            <br>
            &nbsp; Buenos Aires is often called the Paris of South America, mainly 
            because of its architectural image. Regarding the man-woman relation 
            however, it is much different from the Parisian mind. Especially at 
            the present difficult times, the Argentine Catholic church has focused 
            its advocacy in three areas: ferm opposition to nearly all forms of 
            modern contraception, to sex education, and to abortion. At the heart 
            of this opposition lie views about women&#8217;s role in the family, 
            and about maternity and reproduction as key parts of women&#8217;s 
            identity. Increasingly, however, Catholic church officials have sought 
            to justify their faith-based opposition to contraception and abortion 
            in less doctrinal and more &#8220;pragmatic&#8221; terms, such as 
            &#8220;scientific&#8221; proof that condoms prevent neither pregnancy 
            nor sexually transmitted infections or nationalist concerns with population 
            size and growth.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; Historically, a central part of the identity of the political 
            elite in Argentina has been that of a frontier nation to be colonized 
            and populated by Caucasian immigrants from Europe. The most famous 
            expression of this identity is the phrase <em>to rule is to populate</em> 
            attributed to Juan Bautista Alberdi, a central figure in Argentina&#8217;s 
            political history known as the &#8220;father of the Argentine constitution.&#8221; 
            Over the years, the refrain &#8220;to rule is to populate&#8221; has 
            been used by various political actors to justify the limitations on 
            women&#8217;s reproductive autonomy and rights, by reference to women&#8217;s 
            essential role as childbearers and <em>as such</em> tools for population 
            growth. Across the South American region, many governments and legislators 
            have historically declared their opposition to modern birth control 
            methods, usually with reference to Catholic church doctrine. However, 
            in Argentina the government went so far as to prohibit the sale of 
            all contraceptives for several decades in the late twentieth century, 
            an extreme display of opposition to birth control even by regional 
            standards. This pro-natalist approach has historically set Argentina 
            apart from the rest of South America, so much so that Argentina in 
            1996 was the only country in the region to provide no public support 
            of any kind for access to contraception. <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; It is estimated that in Argentina episodes of violence against 
            women exist in 1 of each 5 couples, at different degrees... 42% of 
            the female homicide victims (whose author is discovered) were assassinated 
            by their couples. 37% of the women battered by their marriage partner 
            have been more than 20 years suffering those abuses. According to 
            information, it is estimated that 25% of the Argentine women are victims 
            of violence and that 50% will undergo some violent situations at some 
            moment of their life. More affected group is from 25 to 34 years old. 
            Although no formal studies have been made by the Argentine government, 
            based on the general impoverishment of the population and the report 
            elaborated by UNICEF in 2001 that the situation of women in prostitution 
            has gotten worse considerably. All women in situation of prostitution, 
            including those who vindicate themselves as sexual workers have been 
            object of repeated abuses, illegal pressures and haltings by the police.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; According to data of the National Institute of Statistics and 
            Census of 1997, the percentage of sexually active women between 15 
            to 49 years of age of the main cities that used contraceptive methods 
            varied between 53.2 and 64.6%. Among those with Unsatisfied Basic 
            Needs (poor), this rate was reduced to 43.5% to 54.1%. This indicates 
            a low level of use of contraceptives methods among poor women, that 
            the economic crisis and the absence of programs of reproductive health 
            have worsened. It is estimated that in Argentina, there are around 
            400,000 annual abortions, 37% of the pregnancies end up in abortion. 
            Adolescent pregnancy continues growing, 15.5% of children born alive 
            are from mothers under 20 years old. <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; In 2002, the Argentine congress enact meaningful reform, overcoming 
            vocal opposition from the Catholic church as well as several conservative 
            legislators to pass the National Law on Sexual Health and Responsible 
            Procreation. This law placed reproductive and sexual health on the 
            national political agenda for the first time in Argentina&#8217;s 
            history. Argentina&#8217;s health minister indicated publicly that 
            he thought women&#8217;s health and lives probably would improve if 
            abortion were decriminalized. In response, President <strong>Nestor 
            Kirchner</strong> (elected in 2003) was quick to emphasize that the 
            government&#8217;s position continued to be a &#8220;clear rejection 
            of the legalization of abortion.&#8221; However, Kirchner also defended 
            his government&#8217;s health minister against subsequent attacks 
            from the Catholic church, including by asking the Vatican to retire 
            a bishop who had suggested the health minister should be thrown into 
            the sea with a stone around his neck for his comments.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; President N&eacute;stor Kirchner, while professing belief in 
            the Catholic faith, has often had a troubled relationship with the 
            hierarchy of the Church. Kirchner belongs to the center-left of Peronism 
            and has placed emphasis on certain progressive views that do not go 
            well with some conservative Catholics. The Argentine national government 
            passed laws and began a program to the effect of providing assistance 
            on sex education to all citizens, including the provision of free 
            oral contraceptives and condoms. The Church opposes artificial contraception 
            and has placed conditions on its acceptance of sex education in schools. 
            <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; Nowadays , more than 50% of the Argentinean population is under 
            the line of poverty. There are 18,219,000 poor people, representing 
            51.4% of population in 2002, and 8,319,000 from total poor people 
            are children and adolescents. Citizens find it very difficult to access 
            to public health services, justice and education and to the benefits 
            of social security including retirement. Social benefits are focused 
            only on certain groups and those who apply to be beneficiaries must 
            qualify as addressees of an assistance based on their poverty status. 
            Argentine women live in a situation of serious unprotection of their 
            health, specially sexual and reproductive one. This situation affects 
            more seriously youngest and poor women with low education, and the 
            rural population. Another aspect that aggravates the unprotection 
            of sexual and reproductive rights is the persistence of cultural patterns 
            that, in Argentina, still maintain sexuality like a taboo subject, 
            in particular for women of popular sectors. <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; At the beginning of 2005, the minister of Health made public 
            his support for the legalization of abortion, and Kirchner's silence 
            on the matter angered the Church. In October 2005 conflict erupted 
            again as the Argentine Chamber of Deputies took steps to pass a Sex 
            Education Law that would encompass the whole school system (public 
            and private, including confessional schools), forcing educational 
            establishments to teach students about gender roles and contraception, 
            among other topics. The Archbishop of La Plata accused the state of 
            &quot;promoting sexual corruption&quot; and &quot;inciting fornication, 
            lust and promiscuity&quot;. On the issue of the 1970's, - the Vatican 
            Embassy here kept a secret list of thousands of people who &quot;disappeared&quot; 
            during Argentina's dirty wars of the late 1970s - Kirchner called 
            attention on the many bishops &quot;who weren't there while children 
            were disappearing&quot; and who &quot;gave [the sacrament of] confession 
            to torturers&quot; of the Dirty War. During the 1976-1983 &quot;Dirty 
            War&quot;, an estimated 30,000 people &quot;disappeared&quot;. Members 
            of the opposition later qualified Kirchner as &quot;Liberation Theology&quot;, 
            &quot;unjust&quot; and &quot;intolerant&quot;. <br>

            <br>
            &nbsp; Tolerance is a social, cultural and religious term applied 
            to the collective and individual practice of not persecuting those 
            who may believe, behave or act in ways of which one may not approve. 
            Authoritarian systems practice intolerance or zero tolerance , the 
            opposite of tolerance. Tolerance is seen as a more widely acceptable 
            term than &quot;acceptance&quot; and particularly &quot;respect,&quot; 
            where the application to controversial parties is concerned. <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; In the wider sociological sense, &quot;tolerance&quot; carries 
            with it the understanding that &quot;intolerance&quot; and conformity 
            breeds violence and social instability. &quot;Tolerance&quot; has 
            thus become the social term of choice to define the practical rationale 
            of permitting uncommon social practice and diversity. One only tolerates 
            people who are disliked for their differences. <br>

      <strong>Reframing</strong>, reframen Die Bedeutung, die ein Ereignis, eine 
      Aussage, ein Verhalten, ein Glaubenssatz, ein Ausl&ouml;ser, ein Reiz hat, 
      h&auml;ngt vom Kontext, vom Rahmen ab, in den wir es hineinstellen, den 
      wir ihm geben. Frame ist der Rahmen. Reframing bedeutet, einen neuen Rahmen 
      zu konstruieren, eine neue Bedeutung zu geben. Ein Bild kann in einem neuen 
      Rahmen ganz anders aussehen und anders wirken. Wird ein Problem reframt, 
      dann bekommt dasselbe Ereignis, eine neue Bedeutung: neue Reaktionen und 
      neues Verhalten werden m&ouml;glich. Reframing bezeichnet den Proze&szlig; 
      des Umdeutens: des Einnehmens einer neuen Perspektive, einer neuen Art der 
      Wahrnehmung, einer neuen Interpretation <br>
      Generell wird in NLP nach<strong> (1) Kontext-, (2) Bedeutungs- und (3) 
      Inhalts-Reframing</strong> unterschieden (in manchen F&auml;llen ist diese 
      Einteilung nicht brauchbar). <br>
      (1) Beim Kontext-Reframing wird direkt der Rahmen ver&auml;ndert. Ein Problem 
      wird einen neuen Rahmen gestellt, wo es als Problem verschwindet. Eine scheinbare 
      Ressource wird in einen neuen Rahmen gestellt, wodurch sie zum Problem wird. 
      Ein Beispiel f&uuml;r ersteres: Ein Vater h&auml;lt seine Tochter f&uuml;r 
      &quot;aggressiv&quot;. Man k&ouml;nnte den Vater fragen: in welchem Kontext 
      k&ouml;nnte &quot;die F&auml;higkeit, sich durchzusetzen und sich zu wehren, 
      wenn sie bel&auml;stigt wird&quot; n&uuml;tzlich und willkommen sein? <br>
      (2) Beim Bedeutungs-Reframing (auch Inhalts-Reframing genannt) bleiben Kontext 
      und Situation erhalten, aber die Bedeutung wird ver&auml;ndert. Ein Beispiel: 
      Eine Mutter &auml;rgert sich &uuml;ber die Fu&szlig;abdr&uuml;cke ihrer 
      Kinder am Teppich. &quot;Fu&szlig;abdr&uuml;cke auf dem Teppich&quot; haben 
      f&uuml;r Sie die Bedeutung: &quot;Niemand respektiert mich.&quot; Eine neue 
      Bedeutung k&ouml;nnte sein: &quot;Fu&szlig;abdr&uuml;cke auf dem Teppich&quot; 
      haben die Bedeutung: &quot;Liebe Menschen sind im Haus&quot;. <br>
      3) Der Ausdruck Inhalts-Reframing wird in NLP unterschiedlich verwendet. 
      Manche AutorInnen setzen diesen Ausdruck mit Bedeutungs-Reframing gleich: 
      es geht um die inhaltliche Bedeutung einer Aussage und die Ver&auml;nderung 
      des Bedeutungs-Inhaltes. F&uuml;r andere ist der Ausdruck Inhalts-Reframing 
      ein &Uuml;berbegriff mit dem Kontext- und dem Bedeutungs-Reframing als Sonderf&auml;lle. 
      Beide Reframings k&ouml;nnen n&auml;mlich nur dann durchgef&uuml;hrt werden, 
      wenn der Coach den Inhalt (den Wortlaut) der problematischen Aussage kennt. 
      D.h. im Unterschied zu anderen NLP-Interventionen kann der Coach nicht alleine 
      auf der Proze&szlig;-Ebene agieren, sondern mu&szlig; auch gewisse Inhalte 
      des Problems kennen.
