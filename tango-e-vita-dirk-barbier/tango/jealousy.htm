              <br>
              <br>
              The traditional themes of <strong>tangoshows </strong>are the nuns 
              in the bordello and the knife fight ... <br>
              <br>
              As in tango, many knife-fighters are nothing more than poseurs. 
              However, the true thing is a serious piece of work. Because the 
              focus in tango is't always the female, a show must show some respect 
              for the skill with the blade.<br>
              In the world of knife fighting there is an unspoken rule: Go in, 
              cut and get out unscathed. Knifefighting is a fast, fluid and dangerous 
              affair, to master this most lethal of martial arts demands self-discipline, 
              physical sacrifice and years of intensive training. The experienced 
              knife fighter will easily see an opening and go in for the kill 
              without being countered. The thing is, until you have actually faced 
              a blade in the hands of someone who means you harm, you have no 
              idea how terrifying it is. In that moment of singular clarity, you 
              know: They are assassinations and &quot;knife fighting&quot; is 
              a romantic fantasy that can be deadly. If you think that is bad, 
              what you experience when facing a blade bare handed is even worse. 
              <br>
              <br>
              So the obvious tangostory is... flesh against flesh, the scenario 
              of two jealous men dancing in combat over another woman , the passionate 
              or troubled relationship, the figure of the compradito, the male 
              dancer whose role is nearly always dominant on the stage in danza, 
              a lovers quarrel and uncivilized intimate behaviour, traditions 
              of domination, control and violence. <br>
              <br>
              Seen from a narrative point of view, the role of women in tango 
              is finely a twist-apple.<br>
              <br>
              And beyond the show, one can see mirroring movements of shadows 
              exactly like life ... but this strangely obscures what is happening 
              on the stage, which is only obedience to tango's stage conventions 
              and the tyrannical expectations of the vampire-audience. <br>
              Their version of tangoshow, as milongueros dismissively call it, 
              is to play on old stereotypes, featuring male dancers dressed in 
              faux 1940s tough-guy garb and women in their whorehouse-lite outfits, 
              including fishnet stockings, very highheels and short skirts with 
              long side slit. <br>
              Their dancing is full of kicks, brusque, melodramatic turns and 
              oversized gestures, athleticism and an in-your-face sexuality. Pure 
              Argentine Tango however is subtle. It is a very difficult dance 
              to master, specifically because of the subtlety of the steps as 
              well as the complexity of the lead-follow relationship. <br>
              It is revealing to look at the character interactions as a series 
              of shifts in the both the dance partnership and gender dynamic. 
              <br>
              As a unit, the pair is in a constant state of communication, give 
              and take, control and release. When that release is fully attained, 
              it is a delicious moment for both leader and follower, and the confidence 
              and attitude of the leader is developed. <br>
              Under certain circumstances, with a tuned partnership, the follower 
              can make various types of embellishments according to the tempo 
              of the music, and can even take the lead away briefly.<br>
              <br>
              True, tango is a metaphor for relationship of power, sex, love and 
              control ...<br>
              But in the socialized tangoclub, the rotary is civilized ... <br>
              rules restrict the social intercourse.<br>
              At such <strong>tango de sal&oacute;n</strong>, one can imagine 
              Gustave Flaubert,<br>
              sitting at a table, writing Madame Bovary *...<br>

              <br>
              The milonga dancing, or club dancing, is an intimate art. The milonga 
              is full of those subtle considerations. It's a world of intimacy 
              and freedom , but also very strict codes. The codes are needed because 
              in la milonga, the conventions of normal life are not respected. 
              In what other place do you just accept embracing someone you don't 
              know, close your eyes and surrender? <br>
              There are milongas every day of the week, at lunchtime, in the afternoon 
              and evening, and true milongueros, as milonga regulars are called, 
              keep a schedule of favorites. They all share, however, some strict 
              but unwritten codes, covering everything from the way to dress to 
              the correct, and incorrect, ways of inviting someone to dance.<br>
              <br>
              Appellation Tango Argentin Contr&ocirc;l&eacute;e :<br>
              <br>
              &quot;There are a thousand rules, &quot; says Sonia Abadi, a much 
              respected psychoanalyst by profession, and also a milonguera and 
              author of &quot;El Bazar De Los Abrazos&quot; (The Bazaar Of Embraces) 
              a very entertaining, often fascinating guide to the milonga world. 
              <br>
              &quot;La milonga puts you in a place that borders with transgression 
              of the standard rules, ... because it's the night, because it puts 
              body against body. And the more transgressive a situation is, the 
              more rules are needed.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              The tango at the milonga, danced in a counterclockwise motion on 
              the edges of the floor, has the sensuality of understatement. Tension 
              and trust hold the dancers together. <br>
              The man dances with his eyes open, she dances with her eyes closed 
              so he's guiding her all the time and protecting her with his body 
              so as to not bump into other dancers. She has to trust. What's more, 
              almost instinctively the good dancer, as he sees a potential clash, 
              turns so he gets the brunt of the collision and not the woman. In 
              fact the good dancer is almost by definition, in the tangoworld, 
              a gentleman. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;The milongueros are male geishas,*&quot; says Abadi.<br>
              <br>
              The milonguero is a guy whose aim is to please the woman, make her 
              feel good. The good milonguero must make the woman he's with happy. 
              He doesn't take her to show her off but to make her feel happy. 
              It's like making love. You have those who do it like an athletic 
              event and those who actually take their time to make love. In tango 
              it's the same... <br>
              <br>
              The milonguero is supposed to go to a milonga showered, perfumed 
              and, within his means, well dressed. Many men dance with a jacket 
              on . But if it is too hot they might wear just a shirt but with 
              a vest, a way to keep the woman at a certain distance within the 
              intimacy.<br>
              There are rules about inviting the woman to dance. Men and women 
              usually sit at separate tables at the milonga, although that is 
              changing The tangoman looks and nods. This gives the tangowoman 
              the chance to accept or play to be distracted. A man <i>does not</i> 
              come to the table to take a woman out. That's bad form. And a good 
              female dancer <i>does not</i> accept if a man does such a thing, 
              it would be like selling herself cheap. Unlike in Europe, a woman 
              also doesn't start yelling when she sees a good Valentino or get 
              angry if he doesn't come.<br>
              <br>
              The dance proceeds in <i>tandas</i>, or sets, of five tangos, usually 
              recordings by the same orchestra. The standard set-up features three 
              major styles that alternate in a specific order: tangovals, tango 
              and milonga (also the word for a music style). <br>
              Depending on the place, the DJ might play a set of jazz tunes, Argentine 
              folk music or even rock. At the end of the tanda the floor clears, 
              everybody goes back to their tables and the DJ plays some sort of 
              theme song to clear the palate.<br>
              <br>
              Good dancers know each other and if there are new faces they wait 
              and see. You see them sipping soda water (serious milongueros don't 
              drink alcohol, they do it afterwards) and watching. <br>
              If by chance they take a dancer who is shit, the unspoken rule is 
              that you dance the first two pieces of the tanda and then beg off. 
              Those first two songs are considered 'courtesy dances.'<br>
              &quot;You don't bail out,&quot; says Abadi. After that you can make 
              up an excuse, and you are off the hook. But as a courtesy you don't 
              dance the rest of that <i>tanda</i> with anyone else. That would 
              &nbsp;precisely &nbsp;show up the other person. <br>
              <br>
              So,<em> precisely</em> the knife-fight is still sniping ...<br>
              <br>
              Making a geisha from a knifefighter,<br>
              can give some identity problems,<br>
              or is it the difference between a milonguero and a tanguero ? <br>
              <br>
              <font color="#FF0000" size="4"><strong> From the cabaret girl to 
              the city woman, </strong><br>
              the metropolitan lifestyle adaptation...</font><br>
              <br>
              &nbsp; &nbsp;From 1880 to 1916, Argentina enjoyed increasing prosperity 
              and became one of the top 10 richest countries in the world, the 
              population of the country swelled sevenfold. As the male / female 
              population balance was getting more equal, dating became more normal 
              and the social scene changed. A new consuming public was profiling 
              itself: middle class people with free time and money to spend in 
              the Corrientes Avenue or 'the street that never sleeps', the Broadway 
              of Buenos Aires. Argentine cinema enjoyed a 'golden age' in the 
              1930s through the 1950s, the industry produced actors who became 
              the first movie stars of Argentine cinema, often tango performers. 
              In 1920, Argentina was a pioneering nation in radio broadcasting 
              and by 1925, there were 12 stations in Buenos Aires. The 1930s were 
              the &quot;golden age&quot; of radio in Argentina, with live variety, 
              news, soap opera, sport shows and tango bands such as the studio 
              band RCA Victor put together to sell records. The Orquesta T&iacute;pica 
              Victor started in 1925 and would continue for 15 years, they made 
              more than 400 recordings.<br>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; As the population balance was equal and dating more 
              &quot;mondaine&quot;, both men and women went to crowded tango dancehalls 
              and confiter&iacute;as, where they danced very close, the woman&#8217;s 
              head over her partner&#8217;s right shoulder, so he could whisper 
              in her ear and visa versa, this &quot;cheek to cheek-style&quot; 
              was called apilado, piled up, packed tightly together. Later, with 
              the appearance of the tango in the milonga danceclubs and the sal&oacute;n 
              in the family houses, the tanguero public transformed. From 1940, 
              the tango had to express something more polished than the eroticism 
              of the bordelles and cabarets louche. The aesthetic focus was no 
              longer on sexual desire and carnal pleasures but on the elegant 
              appearance which can be called an illusory deception or over-mystification 
              of the feminine with tangos like &#8220;Mar&iacute;a&#8221;, &#8220;Malena&#8221;, 
              &#8220;Gricel&#8221;, &#8220;Ninguna&#8221;, &#8220;Naranjo en flor&#8221;.

              <br>
              <em>Madame Bovary</em> was published in two volumes in 1857,<br>
              but it appeared originally in the Revue de Paris, 1856-57. <br>
              Emma Bovary is married to Charles Bovary, a physician. As a girl 
              Emma has read Walter Scott, she has romantic dreams and longs for 
              adventure.<br>
              "What exasperated her was that Charles did not seem to notice her 
              anguish. His conviction that he was making her happy seemed to her 
              an imbecile insult, and his sureness on this point ingratitude. 
              <br>
              For whose sake, then was she virtuous? <br>
              Was it not for him, the obstacle to all felicity, the cause of all 
              misery, and, as it were, the sharp clasp of that complex strap that 
              bucked her in on all sides."<br>
              <br>
              <em>What is Geisha ?</em><br>
              “Gei” means accomplishment or performance and “sha” means person.<br>
              At first, Geisha were men and after a while, female Geishas came. 
              <br>
              They were called &quot;On-na-geisha&quot;, &quot;On-na&quot; means 
              woman.<br>
              In the old period, only men went to parties, they needed someone 
              to make them feel relaxed.<br>
              A geisha chat with guests, perform classical Japanese dance, sing 
              songs or play games. <br>
              In &quot;<em>Memoris of a Geisha&quot;</em>, Nitta Sayuri tells 
              us of her life as a geisha. <br>
              We witness her transformation as we enter a world where appearances 
              are everything.<br>
              Behind its facade of haunting beauty the sal&oacute;n turns out 
              to be a viciously competitive place where women compete desperately 
              for men's favor and largess,<br>
              where a girl's virginity is auctioned to the highest bidder,<br>
              where women are trained to beguile and please the most powerful 
              men, <br>
              where personal trust is almost nonexistent ...<br>
              and where love is scorned as illusion.<br>

              <font color="#FF0000" size="4"><strong>La Milonguita </strong>(girl 
              from 14 till her early 20's)</font> <br>
              <em>Young cabaret girl, dances with many men.</em> <br>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; The typical tango-lyric story of &quot;la milonguita&quot; 
              is marked by poverty, ambition, the easy life and then... the fall, 
              decay, death often through tuberculosis. Her story is part of the 
              urban changes that turn Buenos Aires into a metropolis. <br>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; As the city began to expand with &quot;los barrios&quot; 
              or districts, new career paths made it possible to move up the social 
              ladder. <br>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; In a relatively short time, the Buenosairean society 
              was diversified and became more complex. Between end of the first 
              decade of the 20'th century and the 1940's, people of the districts 
              began to frequent &quot;los caf&eacute;s&quot; or coffee houses 
              and cabarets in the buenosaires center, and politicians looking 
              for votes walked the districts making political campaigns. The extension 
              of the free time outside the family homeworld, offered to many new 
              encounters with great opportunities. <br>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus a new consuming public was profiling or stereotyping 
              itself, common people, of the districts, that listened to tangos 
              and danced, read newspapers, magazines and went to the cinema, frequented 
              new socialization fields, from the local club to the &quot;society 
              of promotion&quot; and the bar. The expansion of the transport network 
              facilitated an endless number of interchanges between the world 
              of the districts and the one of the center. Buenos Aires had not 
              only grown but was also more communicated. The mainstreet in the 
              heart of the city, &quot;La calle Corrientes&quot;, became the &quot;neutral 
              territory&quot; on which the culture of the center and the one of 
              the districts &quot;were to taste&quot;. In the decade of the 1920's, 
              the center was already a definitive &quot;free time&quot; reference 
              of the Buenosaireans. For 1923, it was considered that something 
              more than seven million people went to spectacles such as operetas, 
              theaters, dances, comedies, vaudevilles, films. Between the very 
              diverse supplies of the center stood out the brothel, the dance 
              academy, the coffee house and the night club. Some districts also 
              offered those opportunities, but their &quot;er&oacute;tica&quot; 
              was not associated with the world of the center where the supply 
              was more varied and for all budgets. At night in the center of Buenos 
              Aires, men of diverse social origin shared the entertainment adventure 
              offered by women of humble origin. <br>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; It was in that world of interchanges that the milonguita's 
              melodramatic trip form from the district to the city center took 
              place, of her moral fall and &quot;pale tuberculosis end&quot;. 
              The life of these taxi &quot;milonguitas&quot; and &quot;milongueras&quot; 
              (women between 25 and 40) was hard. It was a life of shame, violence, 
              alcoholism, drugs and diseases like tbc. As the rates of syphillis 
              and other sexually transmitted diseases were alarming, a femme fatale 
              became more dangerous than an alluring and seductive &quot;flor 
              de lujo y de placer&quot;, a luxury girl whose charms traped her 
              lovers in bonds of irresistible desires. The threat of these diseases 
              give another connotation to <em>femmes fatales</em> and tango as 
              the forbidden dance. <br>
              <br>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; The leaving from the district to el &quot;centro &quot;is 
              in poems the moment of treason to the origin, the home, the maternal 
              love. It changes the scene, and in that change, the identity of 
              &quot;la muchacha de barrio&quot; or the district girl, begins to 
              alter itself. The tango lyrics place the &quot;milonguita&quot; 
              in city center and particularly in the night club. From 1880 on, 
              a Paris Fever developed and the Argentine society of Buenos Aires 
              reflected a strong desire to imitate whatever French Paris had to 
              offer. Like in Paris, cabarets, night clubs were opened and flourished, 
              and gradually tango advanced from the obscurity of the bordellos 
              to the multicolor lights of city night life, cultivating salon culture 
              codes or etiquette. The night club or &quot;El cabaret&quot;, was 
              a place of &quot;Les ann&eacute;es folles - decadence&quot;, a place 
              in which it was possible to give loose to erotic fantasies and creating 
              a market for commercial sex. <br>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; The tango was the dance and music par excellence of 
              the night club. Attracted by the payment, much better than those 
              than they received in the suburban brothels, the tango musicians 
              undertook their trip to the center. First cabarets appeared outside 
              the center, in Palermo and the low sides of Belgrano. Following 
              its Parisian equivalent, they were summer-restaurants, where it 
              was possible to dance and listen to the fashionable orchestra, by 
              nights near a park. In 1920, they worked all the year as cabarets 
              or restaurant-cabarets, and unfolded luxury and elegance. They were 
              &quot;social epicenters&quot; where the rich ones spent their time 
              and money. <br>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; Three types of women circulated in the night club: 
              1, the <em>&quot;artistas&quot;</em>, the consecrated artists, singers 
              or<em> las cancionistas</em> sometimes dressed like men; 2, the 
              &quot;<em>copears</em>&quot;; much like a caf&eacute; waitresses 
              who's job involves convincing her male customers of the possibility 
              of sexual or romantic intimacy with her in a personalised way, thus 
              they gave conversation and danced with the clients, accompanied 
              them in the drink and, after one long and patient ceremony, sold 
              love and sex; and 3, the<em> &quot;queridas&quot; y &quot;mantenidas&quot;</em>, 
              lovers or ma&icirc;tresses of the clients with money who found in 
              the night club an intimate and permisive space. For most of them, 
              it offered young women from poor families with little education 
              and skills an opportunity to earn a living which was not as arduous 
              as farm or factory work, even though the hours were long. It were 
              women who moved away of the domestic ideal life in the barrio. Some 
              women had chosen a more independent life, maybe for that reason 
              perceived by many men as a danger or a threat to the domestic order. 
              However, there is often a traffic in woman behind the scene and 
              the idealization of a luxurious life is very misleading. Some young 
              girls could be euphemistically titled 'comfort' girls in a new world 
              with an overwhelming passion for consuming. <br>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; Through time, as the male / female population balance 
              was getting more equal, dating became more normal and the scene 
              changed. Now, both men and women went to crowded tango dancehalls 
              and confiter&iacute;as, where they danced very close, the woman&#8217;s 
              head over her partner&#8217;s right shoulder, so he could whisper 
              in her ear and visa versa, this &quot;cheek to cheek-style&quot; 
              was called apilado, piled up, packed tightly together. Later, with 
              the appearance of the tango in the milonga danceclubs and the sal&oacute;n 
              in the family houses, the tanguero public transformed. From 1940, 
              the tango had to express something else than the eroticism of the 
              bordelles and cabarets louche. The aesthetic focus was no longer 
              on sexual desire and carnal pleasures but on the elegant appearance 
              which can be called an illusory deception or over-mystification 
              of the feminine with tangos like &#8220;Mar&iacute;a&#8221;, &#8220;Malena&#8221;, 
              &#8220;Gricel&#8221;, &#8220;Ninguna&#8221;, &#8220;Naranjo en flor&#8221;. 
              <br>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; The aesthetic perceptions experienced today, mark 
              the same perception transformation to idealization or glorification 
              of the perfect embodiment. It looks as if beauty is no longer seen 
              as an object of desire, but as a public object of scientific research 
              and styling. Researchers Fredrickson and Roberts (1997) term this 
              particular perspective &quot;self-objectification&quot;, and describe 
              it as a form of self-consciousness that is characterised by habitual 
              and constant self-monitoring of one's outward appearance to a prescribed 
              ideal image. A lifestyle-oriented social promotion as when Buenos 
              Aires began to expand and new career paths made moving-up possible. 
              In recent years, especially since Argentina's disastrous economic 
              crisis of january 2002, tango tourism has become an important source 
              of revenue for the city's economy and Argentinian males can get 
              an income as a taxi-dancer. Taxi dancers rent themselves to foreign 
              tangotourists for the social dance only, a strange turn.<br>

              &nbsp; Argentine tango as a social dance, is a public activity in 
              which we monitor our bodily appearance and behaviour and strive 
              to create the right impression. The others perceive us and we perceive 
              ourselves as perceived by them. In doing so, we become more and 
              more alike. A look-alike appearance is socially safe. But true tango 
              is subtle, and so is jealousy. Popular shows make it more clear...<br>
              High heels, sexy underwear and knife fighters. The traditional themes 
              of tango shows are the nuns in the bordello and the knife fight. 
              Many knife-fighters are nothing more than poseurs. However, the 
              true thing is a serious piece of art. A show must show some respect 
              for the skill with the blade, the focus in tango is not always the 
              female. Knife fighting is a fast, fluid and dangerous affair, to 
              master this most lethal of martial arts demands self-discipline, 
              physical sacrifice and years of intensive training. The experienced 
              knife fighter will easily see an opening and go in for the kill 
              without being countered. True knife fighting is no romantic fantasy.<br>
              In any Martial Art, the crucial factor is the game of legs, to walk 
              with a perfect balance and grace. In Argentine tango, the body energy-center 
              lies lower than in ballroom tango. A little downwards pressure in 
              the hips, makes the knees bend more and gives a more centered body 
              axes, a sneaking, gliding way of walking. This less royal way of 
              moving is related to knife fighting. The classic story in tango 
              spectacles is the scenario of a woman and two jealous men in combat. 
              Domination, control and violence. Many shows are melodramatic, tangosteps 
              athleticism and an in-your-face sexuality. Seen from a narrative 
              point of view, a women in tango is finely a twist-apple. Beyond 
              the show, one can see mirroring movements exactly like life, but 
              civilized.<br>
              At such tango de salon, one can imagine Gustave Flaubert, at a table, 
              writing Madame Bovary. In a socialized tango club, there are rules 
              about inviting, where to sit and a thousand codes how to look. Who's 
              dancing with whom? Rules restrict the social contact and a male 
              is preferred to turn himself into a geisha, which can give a knife 
              fighter some identity problems. And a tanguero? Promiscuity seems 
              to be the nature of tango, envy is inevitable, to keep a true thing 
              alive? <br>

              Le vrai tango est subtil, la jalousie aussi . Les spectacles populaires 
              font plus comprendre...<br>
              Les hauts talons, lingerie de charme et les bagarreurs au couteau. 
              Les th&egrave;mes traditionnels de spectacles de tango sont les 
              religieuses dans le bordello et la bagarre au couteau. Beaucoup 
              de bagarreurs de couteau ne sont rien d'autre que frimeurs. Pourtant, 
              la vraie chose est un morceau s&eacute;rieux d'art. Un spectacle 
              doit montrer un peu de respect pour la bagarre au couteau, le tango 
              n'est pas toujours la femelle. La bagarre au couteau est une affaire 
              rapide, liquide et dangereuse, ma&icirc;triser ce plus mortel d'arts 
              martiaux demande la ma&icirc;trise de soi, le sacrifice physique 
              et les ann&eacute;es d'entra&icirc;nement intensif. Le bagarreur 
              au couteau exp&eacute;riment&eacute; verra facilement une ouverture 
              et aimera le fait de tuer sans &ecirc;tre r&eacute;pondu. La vraie 
              bagarre au couteau n'est aucune fantaisie romantique. Dans n'importe 
              quel Art Martial, le facteur capital est le jeu de jambes, marcher 
              avec une balance parfaite et une gr&acirc;ce. Dans le tango d'Argentine, 
              le centre d'&eacute;nergie de corps est plus bas alors dans le tango 
              de salle de bal. Un peu en bas la pression dans les gratte-culs, 
              fait les genoux tourner plus et donne des haches de corps plus centr&eacute;es, 
              le fait de voler, la fa&ccedil;on planant de marcher. Cette fa&ccedil;on 
              moins royale de bouger est rattach&eacute;e &agrave; la bagarre 
              au couteau. L'histoire classique est le sc&eacute;nario d'une femme 
              et de deux hommes jaloux, en bataille. La domination, le contr&ocirc;le 
              et la violence. Beaucoup de spectacles sont m&eacute;lodramatiques, 
              l'athl&eacute;tisme &eacute;rotique sans aucun complexe. Le version 
              clich&eacute; du tangoshow doit jouer sur de vieux st&eacute;r&eacute;otypes, 
              comportant les danseurs masculins habill&eacute;s dans la tenue 
              des ann&eacute;es 40 et les femmes dans leur sous-v&ecirc;tements 
              sexy, avec des jarretelles et les plus hauts talons .Vu d'un point 
              de vue narratif, le r&ocirc;le des femmes dans le tango est finement 
              un &eacute;ternel conflit. <br>
              Au-del&agrave; du spectacle, on peut voir des mouvements refl&eacute;tants 
              exactement comme la vie, mais civilis&eacute;. &Agrave; un tel tango 
              du salon, on peut imaginer Gustave Flaubert, &agrave; une table, 
              en &eacute;crivant la Madame Bovary. Dans un club de tango socialis&eacute;, 
              il y a des r&egrave;gles de l'invitation, o&ugrave; s'asseoir et 
              mille codes comment regarder. Les r&egrave;gles restreignent le 
              contact social et on pr&eacute;f&egrave;re qu'un m&acirc;le se transforme 
              en une geisha, qui peut donner quelques probl&egrave;mes d'identit&eacute; 
              &agrave; un bagarreur de couteau. Et un tanguero ? La promiscuit&eacute; 
              semble &ecirc;tre la nature de tango, l'envie est in&eacute;vitable, 
              maintenir une vraie chose en vie ?<br>

              O tango verdadeiro &eacute; sutil, o ci&uacute;me tamb&eacute;m 
              . Os espet&aacute;culos populares fazem-no mais claro...<br>
              Altos saltos, roupa de baixo sexy e lutadores de faca. Os temas 
              tradicionais de espet&aacute;culos de tango s&atilde;o as freiras 
              no bordel e a luta de faca. Muitos lutadores de faca n&atilde;o 
              s&atilde;o nada mais do que pessoas afetadas. Contudo, a coisa verdadeira 
              &eacute; um peda&ccedil;o s&eacute;rio da arte. Um espet&aacute;culo 
              deve mostrar um pouco de respeito &agrave; habilidade com a l&acirc;mina, 
              o foco no tango &eacute; n&atilde;o sempre a f&ecirc;mea. A luta 
              de faca &eacute; um assunto pronto, fluido e perigoso, dominar isto 
              o mais letal de artes marciais exige autodom&iacute;nio, sacrif&iacute;cio 
              f&iacute;sico e anos do treinamento intensivo. O lutador de faca 
              experimentado ver&aacute; facilmente uma abertura e vai se ocupar 
              da matan&ccedil;a sem ser contariado. A luta de faca verdadeira 
              n&atilde;o &eacute; nenhuma fantasia rom&acirc;ntica. Em qualquer 
              Arte Marcial, o fator crucial &eacute; o jogo de pernas, andar com 
              um saldo perfeito e gra&ccedil;a. No tango argentino, o centro de 
              energia de corpo est&aacute; mais baixo ent&atilde;o no tango de 
              sal&atilde;o de baile. Um pouco para baixo pressione nos quadris, 
              faz os joelhos curvar-se mais e d&aacute; uns machados de corpo 
              mais centrados, tomar furtivamente, modo que desliza de andar. Este 
              modo real menos de mover-se est&aacute; relacionado &agrave; luta 
              de faca. A hist&oacute;ria cl&aacute;ssica em espet&aacute;culos 
              de tango &eacute; o cen&aacute;rio de uma mulher e dois homens ciumentos 
              no combate. Domina&ccedil;&atilde;o, controle e viol&ecirc;ncia. 
              Muitos espet&aacute;culos s&atilde;o melodram&aacute;ticos, atletismo 
              e uma sexualidade &quot;na sua face&quot;. Visto de um ponto de 
              narrativa da vis&atilde;o, umas mulheres no tango s&atilde;o finamente 
              uma ma&ccedil;&atilde; de guinada. Al&eacute;m do espet&aacute;culo, 
              cada um pode ver movimentos de espelhamento de disco exatamente 
              como vida, mas civilizado. Em tal tango de sal&atilde;o, cada um 
              pode imaginar Gustave Flaubert, em uma mesa, escrevendo a Senhora 
              Bovary. Em um clube de tango socializado, h&aacute; regras sobre 
              o convite, onde sentar-se e mil codes como olhar. As regras restringem 
              o contato social e um macho &eacute; preferido para converter-se 
              em uma gueixa, que pode dar a um lutador de faca alguns problemas 
              de identidade. E um tanguero? A promiscuidade parece ser a natureza 
              do tango, a inveja &eacute; inevit&aacute;vel, guardar uma coisa 
              verdadeira viva? <br>

              Wahrer Tango ist fein, Neid auch . Popul&auml;re Shows machen es 
              klarer...<br>
              Hoch Fersen, erotische Unterkleidung und Messer-K&auml;mpfer. Die 
              traditionellen Themen von Tango-Shows sind die Nonnen im bordello 
              und dem Messer-Kampf. Viele Messer-K&auml;mpfer sind nichts anderes 
              als Wichtigtuer. Jedoch ist das wahre Ding ein ernstes Kunstst&uuml;ck. 
              Eine Show muss etwas R&uuml;cksicht f&uuml;r die Sachkenntnis mit 
              der Klinge zeigen, der Fokus im Tango ist nicht immer die Frau. 
              Das Messer-K&auml;mpfen ist eine schnelle, fl&uuml;ssige und gef&auml;hrliche 
              Angelegenheit, das meist t&ouml;dlich von Kampfsportarten zu meistern, 
              fordert Selbstbeherrschung, physisches Opfer und Jahre der intensiven 
              Ausbildung. Der erfahrene Messer-K&auml;mpfer wird eine &Ouml;ffnung 
              leicht sehen und sich mit der T&ouml;tung befassen ohne, entgegnet 
              zu werden. Das wahre Messer-K&auml;mpfen ist keine romantische Phantasie. 
              <br>
              In jeder Kriegerischen Kunst ist der entscheidende Faktor das Spiel 
              von Beinen, mit einem vollkommenen Gleichgewicht und Gnade spazieren 
              zu gehen. Im argentinischen Tango liegt das K&ouml;rperenergiezentrum 
              tiefer dann im Ballsaal-Tango. Ein wenig abw&auml;rts l&auml;sst 
              der Druck in den H&uuml;ften, die Knie sich mehr biegen und gibt 
              mehr centered K&ouml;rper&auml;xte, eine verstohlene, gleitende 
              Weise spazieren zu gehen. Diese weniger k&ouml;nigliche Weise sich 
              zu bewegen ist mit dem Messer-K&auml;mpfen verbunden. Die klassische 
              Geschichte in Tango-Brillen ist das Drehbuch einer Frau und zwei 
              eifers&uuml;chtiger M&auml;nner im Kampf. &Uuml;berlegenheit, Kontrolle 
              und Gewalt. Viele Shows sind melodramatisch, Sportlichkeit und eine 
              Sexualit&auml;t &quot;in Ihrem Gesicht&quot;. Gesehen von einem 
              Bericht-Gesichtspunkt sind Frauen im Tango fein ein Drehungsapfel. 
              Au&szlig;er der Show kann man widerspiegelnde Bewegungen genau wie 
              Leben, aber zivilisiert sehen.<br>
              An solchem Tango de Salon kann man sich Gustave Flaubert bei einem 
              Tisch vorstellen, Frau Bovary schreibend. In einem sozialisierten 
              Tango-Klub gibt es Regeln &uuml;ber das Einladen, wo zu sitzen und 
              eintausend Codes, wie man schaut. Regeln schr&auml;nken den sozialen 
              Kontakt ein, und ein Mann wird bevorzugt, um sich in eine Geisha 
              zu verwandeln, die einem Messer-K&auml;mpfer einige Identit&auml;tsprobleme 
              geben kann. Und ein tanguero? Promiskuit&auml;t scheint die Natur 
              des Tangos zu sein, Neid ist unvermeidlich, ein wahres Ding zu bewahren?<br>

              &nbsp; Nada hay tan &iacute;ntimo y p&uacute;blico a la vez&#8230; 
              como bailar. El tango, como toda manifestaci&oacute;n popular, nace 
              espont&aacute;neamente en Argentina, resultado de la necesidad de 
              expresi&oacute;n del pueblo, a fines de la d&eacute;cada de 1870. 
              Es el lenguaje del cuerpo que permite al alma expresar sus sentimientos, 
              pasi&oacute;n y fuerza que crea y se recrea en la belleza y la din&aacute;mica 
              del movimiento. Fuertes emociones, en particular, que llevan a los 
              &oacute;rganos a un punto de exaltaci&oacute;n que espont&aacute;neamente 
              se manifiesta a si mismo a trav&eacute;s de movimientos m&aacute;s 
              o menos r&iacute;tmicos que constituyen lo que se podr&iacute;a 
              considerar como danzas naturales. Las expresiones espontaneas, como 
              tambien el arte de bailar, pueden ser descritos como una expresi&oacute;n 
              de los sentimientos por medio de los movimientos del cuerpo mas 
              o menos controlados por el propio sentido r&iacute;tmico. El baile, 
              como arte era utilizado para varios prop&oacute;sitos. El arte existe 
              en todos lados de la ciudad y en formas infinitas. <br>
              &nbsp; La sensualidad del tango, la conexi&oacute;n corporal, puede 
              ser muy pesada, apasionada, y seria. En el tango no exist&iacute;a 
              la regularidad de las viejas danzas como el vals o la polca y por 
              eso fue necesario creer una t&eacute;cnica en la cual la pareja 
              pod&iacute;a realizar una figura en el momento sin anticipaci&oacute;n. 
              El lugar donde se desarroll&oacute; m&aacute;s el tango al principio 
              del sigo XX fue dentro de las burdeles donde los hombres bailaban 
              en una forma mucho m&aacute;s sensual que permitir&iacute;an las 
              estrictas reglas sociales de la sociedad respetuosa. La mujer ten&iacute;a 
              que seguir siempre el hombre paso por paso movi&eacute;ndose con 
              sus caprichos y as&iacute; se fue formando la estructura de la danza 
              que se sigue bailando hoy en d&iacute;a. En un baile tan &iacute;ntimo, 
              no se puede bailar con cualquier hombre. As&iacute; que la mirada 
              tiene un papel muy importante en la cultura del tango. La mirada 
              en el baile es intima pero liviana. La mirada tambi&eacute;n existe 
              en relaci&oacute;n al publico, que est&aacute; siempre presente 
              en los milongas. El tango es como un espejo, en su capacidad de 
              reflejar todo el desarrollo de una identidad social y relaciones 
              sociales. <br>
              &nbsp; <em>Las transformaciones en el esp&iacute;ritu del tango</em><br>
              &nbsp; La pregunta que se impone, es: <em>&iquest; por qu&eacute; 
              el tango, m&uacute;sica del instinto sexual y de la algarab&iacute;a 
              prostibularia se convierte en tan pocos a&ntilde;os en un discurso 
              que afirma valores morales tan opuestos a los que le dieron origen? 
              &iquest;Por qu&eacute; el placer se transmuta en condena y el regocijo 
              en melancol&iacute;a ? </em> <br>
              &nbsp; Entre 1900 y 1910 ese incipiente tango que se expresaba en 
              prost&iacute;bulos y arrabales de las afueras de la ciudad, empez&oacute; 
              lentamente a ganar terreno en los cabarets y peque&ntilde;os teatros 
              de Buenos Aires. De sus origines el tango fue una expresi&oacute;n 
              cultural degenerado muy particular a la situaci&oacute;n social 
              Argentina, pero cuando el tango fue aprobado al exterior se convirti&oacute; 
              de repente en una imagen de la identidad nacional. Igualmente, se 
              concretan ciertos s&iacute;mbolos sociales que pasar&aacute;n a 
              formar parte del folklore ciudadano. Para los &eacute;lites Argentinos 
              el tango todav&iacute;a pertenec&iacute;a a otro sector de la sociedad, 
              y implicaba una identidad ajena de los inmigrantes, los guapos, 
              las prostitutas y todo un mundo nocturnal y peligroso de la calle. 
              La m&uacute;sica es otra forma de arte que es muy importante en 
              la cultura argentina. Muchos argentinos hablan de ella con tanta 
              pasi&oacute;n y orgullo. La historia del tango entra as&iacute; 
              en un contexto m&aacute;s amplio de historia de gente exiliada y 
              ileg&iacute;tima en b&uacute;squeda de una identidad propia, reconocimiento 
              y dignidad. <br>
              &nbsp; El tango, apadrinado por los grupos sociales que el centro 
              no admit&iacute;a: inmigrantes, veteranos del ej&eacute;rcito, ex-esclavos, 
              todos proletarios en busca de una nueva vida que superara el perfil 
              miserable y prom&iacute;scuo de su marginaci&oacute;n. El Lunfardo, 
              una lengua que muchos asimilan a gente de mala vida, empleada para 
              que resultara incomprensible a las autoridades. En ese &quot;idioma&quot; 
              popular ya por entonces caracter&iacute;stico de los bajos fondos, 
              predominan los t&eacute;rminos de diversos dialectos italianos, 
              con algo de caf&eacute; gitano espa&ntilde;ol y el argot franc&eacute;s. 
              El tango lo elegir&aacute; posteriormente como su lengua predilecta, 
              ya ampliamente divulgada por el teatro y el intercambio personal 
              que se hac&iacute;a en los numerosos sitios bailables, y otros lugares 
              no muy santos, entre &quot;ni&ntilde;os bien&quot; del centro y 
              &quot;compadritos&quot; orilleros. As&iacute;, el tango pasa a los 
              caf&eacute;s y bares del centro, donde el contacto entre las diferentes 
              clases sociales resulta ya cosa normal y corriente. Es en los salones 
              donde comienza una nueva etapa para la m&uacute;sica ciudadana, 
              sea como m&uacute;sica como para danza. Cuando el tango &quot;se 
              hace decente&quot;, sin cortes ni quebradas, para alegrar fiestas 
              de familia, viviendo un notable auge que arranca a principios de 
              la d&eacute;cada del '30 y eclosiona con una popularidad sin igual 
              entre 1940 y 1960. Cuando se extiende a toda la ciudad y se convierte 
              en la m&uacute;sica de Buenos Aires, cuando proliferan compositores 
              y poetas, es el mismo tango el que dice de s&iacute; mismo ser un 
              veneno que fascina, capaz de llevar a las almas m&aacute;s nobles 
              por el camino del mal. Hoy, merced a la llegada de oleadas de turistas 
              extranjeros que hacen florecer la econom&iacute;a e incentivan la 
              inversi&oacute;n en locales de entretenimientos y academias de baile, 
              el tango est&aacute; viviendo un renacer que algunos a&ntilde;os 
              atr&aacute;s nadie hubiera imaginado. <br>

              Il vero tango &egrave; elusivo, dunque &egrave; la gelosia. Le mostre 
              popolari lo fanno pi&ugrave; chiaro....<br>
              Gli alti talloni, i combattenti di biancheria intima e coltello 
              erotici. I temi tradizionali di mostre di tango sono le suore nel 
              bordello ed il coltello lottano. Molti coltello-combattenti non 
              sono niente pi&ugrave; di il poseurs. Comunque, la vera cosa &egrave; 
              un pezzo serio di arte. Una mostra deve mostrare del rispetto per 
              l'abilit&agrave; con la lama, il centro d'interesse nel tango non 
              &egrave; sempre la femmina. La lotta di coltello &egrave; un digiuno, 
              un liquido ed un affare pericoloso, approfondire questo pi&ugrave; 
              letale di stesso-disciplina di richieste di arti marziale, il sacrificio 
              fisico e gli anni di allenamento intenso. Il combattente di coltello 
              esperto vedr&agrave; facilmente che un'apertura e va in per l'uccide 
              senza essendo contraddetto. La vera lotta di coltello &egrave; nessuna 
              fantasia romantica. <br>
              In qualunque Arte Marziale, il fattore cruciale &egrave; il gioco 
              di gambe, camminare con un equilibrio perfetti e con la grazia. 
              Nel tango Argentino, le bugie di energia-centro di corpo abbassano 
              poi nel tango di sala da ballo. Una piccola pressione gi&uacute; 
              nei fianchi, fa le ginocchia piegano pi&ugrave; e d&agrave; a una 
              pi&ugrave; accette di corpo concentrate, un insinuare, scorrendo 
              la maniera di camminare. Questa maniera meno reale di trasloco &egrave; 
              raccontata alla lotta di coltello. La storia classica negli spettacoli 
              di tango &egrave; lo scenario di una donna e due uomini gelosi nel 
              combattimento. La dominazione, il controllo e la violenza. Molte 
              mostre sono melodrammatiche, l'athleticism ed un in-il suo-il sexuality 
              di faccia. Visto da un punto di vista di narrazione, une donne nel 
              tango &egrave; bellamente una torsione-mela. Oltre la mostra, un 
              pu&ograve; vedere rispecchia i movimenti esattamente come la vita, 
              ma civilizzato. <br>
              A tale salone di de di tango, un pu&ograve; immaginare Gustave Flaubert, 
              a una tavola, scrivendo Bovary di Signora. In un club di tango socializzato, 
              ci sono delle regole di invita, dove sedere e mille codici come 
              guardare. Le regole limitano il contatto sociale ed un maschio &egrave; 
              preferito girars&eacute; in un geisha, che pu&ograve; dare un combattente 
              di coltello alcuni problemi di identit&agrave;. Ed un tanguero? 
              La promiscuit&agrave; sembra essere la natura di tango, l'invidia 
              &egrave; inevitabile, per tenere una vera cosa viva? <br>

              Sann tango er subtil, s&aring; er sjalusi. Popul&aelig;re utstillinger

              I noe Milit&aelig;r Kunst, er den kritiske faktoren spillet av bein, 
              g&aring; med en perfekt balanse og ynde. I Argentine tango senker 
              kroppenergi-midtpunktsom l&oslash;gnene da i dansesal tango. Litt 
              nedover trykk i hoftene, lager knebendet mere og gir en mere sentrert 
              kropp&oslash;kser, et sniker, gli m&aring;te av &aring; g&aring;. 
              Dette mindre kongelig m&aring;te av &aring; flytte forholder seg 
              til kniv&aring; sl&aring;ssing. Den klassiske historien i tango 
              spectacles er scenariet av en kvinne og to sjalu menn i kamp. Herred&oslash;me, 
              styring og vold. Mange utstillinger er melodramatiske, athleticism 
              og et i-Deres-ansikt sex. Sett fra et fortellingssynspunkt, en kvinner 
              i tango er fint et vridning-eple. Hinsides utstillingen ser en avspeilende 
              bevegelser n&oslash;yaktig som liv, men sivilisert. P&aring; slik 
              tango de salong forestiller en seg Gustave Flaubert, p&aring; en 
              tabell, skrive Madame Bovary. I en sosialisert tango klubb er det 
              regel om ber, hvor sitte og en tusenkoder hvordan se. Regel innskrenker 
              den sosiale kontakten og en hann foretrekker vende seg inn i en 
              geisha, gir som en knivkjemper noe identitetsproblemer. Og en tanguero? 
              Promiscuity synes v&aelig;re naturen av tango, er misunnelse uunng&aring;elig, 
              beholde en sann ting levende?<br>

              <strong> Sonia Abadi: Der Basar Der Umarmungen.</strong> </font><br>
              <br>
              Die Autorin ist Ärztin und Psychoanalytikerin und ausserdem Kennerin 
              der Tango-Szene. <br>
              In den kurzen Kapiteln wird jeweils auf einbestimmtes Phänomen eingegangen: 
              Die großen Gefühle, Die Sucht nach der Milonga, das "Cabecear", 
              Unterschiede zwischen Tangoneulingen und "alten Hasen", Anonymität 
              und Intimität, Tango-Accessoires, die Faux-Pas der Europäer, und 
              vieles mehr. Liebevoll schildert Abadi die kleien Marotten, ohne 
              bloßzustellen und entwickelt so ein höchst unterhaltsames Panorama.

              El bazar de los abrazos : <br>
              <br>
              &#8220;La Milonga...sala de guardia permanente para los enfermos 
              de tango, de vida, de encuentro, de sue&ntilde;os.&#8221; <br>
              &#8220;Viaje de milonga en milonga, navegantes solitarios que llegan 
              a puertos inquietantes o seguros, recorriendo los canales de esa 
              ciudad oculta tan dormida, despierta e insomne.&#8221;<br>
              &#8220;La especie humana, y muy especialmente la raza de los que 
              frecuentan la milonga, se debate entre dos miedos igualmente aterradores: 
              el miedo a la soledad y el miedo al compromiso.&#8221; <br>
              &#8220;En estos d&iacute;as de soledades f&iacute;sicas en que amistad, 
              sexo y afecto encuentran soluciones de internet , el tango ofrece 
              la oportunidad de un encuentro vivo, cuerpo a cuerpo, a la vez que 
              un espacio para vivir experiencias de diversa calidad emocional, 
              sensual y art&iacute;stica.&#8221;<br>
              &#8220;Animal de dos cabezas, un s&oacute;lo cuerpo y cuatro patas. 
              Ser mitol&oacute;gico mitad hombre y mitad mujer. Monstruo que se 
              abraza a s&iacute; mismo. Entrevero de piernas que se esquivan y 
              se rozan. Mosaico de piel morena con piel clara , piernas vestidas 
              y desnudas, brazos fuertes y brazos fr&aacute;giles.&#8221;<br>
              &#8220;Encuentro que comienza en la mirada, contin&uacute;a en el 
              abrazo y se despliega en el baile. Contrapunto de experiencia con 
              creatividad, equilibrio con sensibilidad, comunicaci&oacute;n c&oacute;mplice 
              con esquiva seducci&oacute;n.&#8221;<br>
              &#8220;Si bailar es placer del cuerpo y del esp&iacute;ritu atravesados 
              por la m&uacute;sica, bailar abrazados agrega la sensualidad. Pero 
              bailar tango a&ntilde;ade la destreza, el juego, el arte de improvisar 
              de a dos.&#8221; <br>
              &#8220;Luz y sombra, destellos y penumbra, claroscuro. Luz artificial 
              del sal&oacute;n, brillo de las ropas femeninas, penumbra de la 
              pareja con los ojos entrecerrados en un improvisado zagu&aacute;n.&#8221; 
              <br>
              &#8220;All&iacute; en la milonga hombre y mujer escribir&aacute;n 
              su novela, que expresa la medida de su prisi&oacute;n cotidiana 
              y la inmensidad de su sue&ntilde;o de libertad.&#8221;<br>
              &#8220;Es cierto que en la Argentina la crisis y el tango siempre 
              anduvieron a la par. Los amantes del tango creen que el tango es 
              hijo de la crisis, su voz m&aacute;s autorizada. Sus cr&iacute;ticos 
              creen que la crisis casi cr&oacute;nica que padecemos es heredera 
              del esp&iacute;ritu tanguero que habita en cada porte&ntilde;o.&#8221;<br>
              &#8220;As&iacute; baila Buenos Aires. Con el pasado en presente 
              y el presente continuo, al son de viejas orquestas y letras que 
              cuentan historias de otros tiempos, pero baila hoy.&#8221; <br>
              &#8220;Milongueros y milongueras, tangueros y tangueras disfrutan 
              de un bien merecido aunque tard&iacute;o reconocimiento. Saber bailar, 
              saber de tangos, conocer esa historia no oficial del pa&iacute;s 
              que cuentan las letras de tango, hoy es un privilegio.&#8221; <br>
              <br>
              Pregunt&eacute; a los tantos extranjeros que ven&iacute;an a Buenos 
              Aires a bailar, por qu&eacute; se hab&iacute;an apasionado de ese 
              modo con nuestro tango.<br>
              La respuesta era siempre la misma:<br>
              &#8220;por el abrazo&#8221;. </font></p>

                        &nbsp; The 2005<EM> Mundial de Tango</EM>-championship 
                        counts on several new features, like a market <EM>una 
                        feria</EM> in which it is possible to find the clothes 
                        and the shoes that are used to dance tango, jewels, discs 
                        and photographies. The activities of the contest were 
                        not made in different seats but that they are concentrated 
                        in the <EM>Rural de Palermo</EM>, the greater estate of 
                        the capital, where it mounted a room with capacity for 
                        3,600 <STRONG>spectators </STRONG>and spaces dedicated 
                        to the dance classes.<BR>
                        <BR>
                        &nbsp; Today, the foreigners who participate in Buenos 
                        Aires of the III World-wide Championship of Dance of Tango 
                        try to overthrow the Argentineans, winners of previous 
                        editions. The first edition of the match in 2003, had 
                        20 pairs of other countries. Now registered 96 on a total 
                        of 412. In the 2005 contest compete more than 29 countries, 
                        between its semifinalists are Spaniards, Hungarian and 
                        Japanese, in addition to several Latin American representatives. 
                        <BR>
                        <BR>
                        Between the pairs that arrive from the outside there are 
                        some similarities: all take advantage of the trip to become 
                        qualified taking classes and, of course, concurring to 
                        whatever milongas they can. Many are "the front" of their 
                        own milongas, academies or compañías de danza. And they 
                        do not speak to gain the championship as objective of 
                        the trip, but rather to learn, to amuse themselves, to 
                        live the experience, to represent well its countries. 
                        By the level of the competition, all arrived after gained 
                        championships in their places from origin, and being competing 
                        in this sure championship, already is a prize. <BR>
                        <BR>
                        There is another element, the economic one, that it indicates 
                        that the more devaluated, the more foreign friends. So 
                        the district tango becomes the Argentina tourist trip 
                        supply, with hotels five stars including, milongas are 
                        diversified and now it has for all the tastes. Cinema 
                        and Literature makes of the tango their subject. There 
                        are tanguerías, tango-schools, tango-studies, academies, 
                        and the industry of tanguero souvenir is multiplied to 
                        unsuspected limits. <BR>
                        <BR>
                        The increase of foreign participants means that there 
                        were qualifying championships in Russia, Italy, Spain, 
                        Japan, Australia, Colombia, Uruguay, Chile and Brasil. 
                        The competitors passed selections in their cities, towns 
                        and countries, and now they arrive at Buenos Aires from 
                        Colombia, Korea, Costa Rica, Chile, Honduras, Hungary, 
                        Japan, Mexico, Paraguay, Portugal, the Ukraine, Uruguay 
                        and Venezuela. Also there are Argentineans. Buenos Aires 
                        sends pairs of 34 parties, the rest of the provinces has 
                        40 representations, whereas the city counts with 23 pairs 
                        to defend his localía.<BR>
                        <BR>
                        For all of them, <STRONG>the women</STRONG> look for the 
                        perfection and they are not not satisfied to just being 
                        beautiful (<EM>En cada caso, las mujeres buscan la perfección 
                        y no se conforman con ser hermosas</EM> ). Also they fly 
                        or move in such a way that it seems that they do not touch 
                        the floor to move in the rhythm, grasped to the males, 
                        who shine less but work more. <BR>
                        <STRONG>The men</STRONG> show that, at least in the tango, 
                        it is possible to be virile well and refine at the same 
                        time, challenging, protective and boldly. They mark the 
                        rhythm and devote themselves to defy the envy of others 
                        with the prettiest woman and better ballerina (<EM>Ellos 
                        marcan el ritmo y se dedican a desafiar la envidia de 
                        los otros con la mujer más linda y mejor bailarina</EM>). 
                        At the other side is <STRONG>the public</STRONG>,<EM> 
                        el público que sabe de tango</EM>, and the juries who 
                        almost cannot explain how there are going to decide who 
                        are the best and who wins.<BR>
                        <BR>
                        &nbsp; <STRONG>The jury</STRONG>: we watch the position, 
                        the presence and the elegance - <EM>la postura, la presencia 
                        y la elegancia</EM> -, everything what the couple does 
                        that <STRONG>if one does not listen to the sound, watches 
                        of distant spot and we say ` they dance tango`, as in 
                        a postcard - <EM>si uno no escucha el sonido, mira de 
                        lejos y decimos `lla bailan tango`, como en una postal.</EM></STRONG> 
                        We value that the pairs are transferred according to the 
                        codes of behavior of the hall; that they walk in the sense 
                        in opposition to the clock, that lean well in the floor, 
                        they do not loosen, they do not jump nor they make hooks. 
                        The jury will evaluate that the pairs exactly fulfill 
                        the basic position (<EM>que las parejas cumplan al pie 
                        de la letra la posición básica</EM>) that characterizes 
                        the <EM>pasos milongueros</EM> of <STRONG>tango salón</STRONG>: 
                        el abrazo - the hug / embrace. While music lasts the dancers 
                        will not be able to separate and will have to move in 
                        the sense in counter clock wise, within the space that 
                        the hug allows. <STRONG>Gimnasia artística</STRONG>: Salon 
                        tango is more difficult that a tango fantasy. It is danced 
                        to the floor, with much feeling and elegance, without 
                        making figures (<EM>Es más difícil que un tango fantasía.

                        cambiar las vidas de los bailarines la obtención del título 
                        de Campeones Mundiales, en el Festival de la meca del

                        For Gisella Galeassi and Gaspar Godoy, two Cordovans of 
                        21 and 20 years that were the first World-wide Champions 
                        from Tango Scene 2004- <STRONG>Tango Escenario</STRONG>, 
                        the change was great. They were changed together to Buenos 
                        Aires and they began to live, finally, of the dance. "They 
                        began to consider us professional", says el campeón.. 
                        "a long time ago that we wanted to come to Buenos Aires, 
                        but it was not easy. From renting (they request a guarantee 
                        to you of Capital), to knowing people the atmosphere and 
                        offering you work (hasta conocer gente del ambiente y 
                        ofrecer tu trabajo). It was the push that we needed - 
                        Este fue <EM>el empujón</EM> que nos faltaba". As World-wide 
                        Champions of Tango, Gisella and Gastón represented Argentina 
                        in Festivales of Paris, Malaga, Chicago, Japan, Chile 
                        and Uruguay. The GCBA gave a contract them that overcomes 
                        east month and it facilitated the proceedings to them 
                        for the rent of a department in which they live from November 
                        of the last year. Since then, many professional doors 
                        opened that they before saw distant. Also they value the 
                        prize of to have shared scenes with ídolos that a month 
                        back admired by television, bailar en el Colón.&nbsp;

                        prize opened many doors to us, but it is not a easy way. 
                        What before it was impossible, now can get to occur; it 
                        does not mean that we do not have to work like dogs to 
                        obtain it. Most important that she happened to us is to 
                        have grown like dancers - El premio nos abrió muchas puertas, 
                        pero no es un camino fácil. Lo que antes era imposible, 
                        ahora puede llegar a darse; no significa que no tengamos 
                        que trabajar como perros para lograrlo. Lo más importante 
                        que nos pasó es haber crecido como bailarines.<BR>

                        Salon</STRONG> the outcome was different. The pair that 
                        had formed <EM>en noches de milonga en Besos Brujos</EM>, 
                        outside<EM> las pistas</EM>, it was not the same. Apparently, 
                        the real milonga situation is more complicated to take 
                        when there are jealous husbands ( <EM>esta situación es 
                        más complicada de llevar cuando hay maridos celosos de

                        life.<BR>
