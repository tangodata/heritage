          &nbsp; Dance is a physical need. A step is more than a step. The dynamics 
          which are built in dancing, work at the same time as points (heartbeat-centres) 
          and as waves (heartbeat-pulsation circulation-movement), physicist call 
          it a paradoxical functioning. <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; <a href="http://users.pandora.be/Tango-E-Vita/tangoiste/tangolessen/gavito.htm" title="The secret of tango is in this moment of improvisation that happens between step and step. It is to make the impossible thing possible: to dance silence. This is essential to learn in tangodance, the real dance, that of the silence, of following the melody" target="_blank"><em>Immobility</em></a> 
          is not the absence of any movement: it hides in her a prodigious complicacy 
          of overlapped movements. The agitation which they cause cancels each 
          other out mutually in perfection. <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; This symmetrical heartbeat of building and demolition is necessarily 
          made from knots. Embraces which are at the same time centres of building 
          and demolition, so that it works as a heartbeat of stationary waves. 
          Due to this perfect symmetry, both effects cancel each other out permanently: 
          nothing more moves, nothing more takes place. These heartbeatcentres 
          will be able to act as &quot;points of departure&quot; on which will 
          be built a new cycle. With each step the dancers are getting more involved, 
          more engaged with each other through the music. Performances are becoming 
          more and more cyclic, which means that things are moved from real life, 
          arranged in patterns and performed as dance, and then carried back into 
          real life through embodied knowledge, so creating a cycle. A living 
          act in the moment as it happens. <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; Dancing is a system that intermediates between extremes, it's 
          a catalysing development <em>inside the body</em>. It can bring a certain 
          level of excitation, maybe <a href="http://users.pandora.be/Tango-E-Vita/tangoiste/tangolessen/feetwork.htm" title="Symbolic_Meanings_TangoDancing " target="_blank">erotic</a>, 
          even some violent movements in the act of teasing. This playing refers 
          to the act of engaging in unrestrained, amusing interaction like disturbing 
          another person, often in the context of learning how to tease each other 
          better. <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; Tension, charge, discharge and relaxation is the beat of the 
          body.&nbsp; It has a perfect tempo, not the same as the mechanic time-pitch 
          of a metronome, perhaps more like Taiko drums, which have a religious 
          role, are used to intimidate the enemy during battle and to communicate. 
          The capacity for surrender to the flow of biological impulses without 
          any inhibition, is one of the mysteries of the organism. <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; Despite the fact that social dance displays a certain social 
          culture, lifestyle exhibits, there is still a sense of the risqué involved 
          in tango's fictional frame. Dancing Argentine tangos, it gives an energy 
          that an increasing number of people find exciting. It's pulse is stronger 
          than inhibitory factors such as inhibition due to the threat of performance-failure 
          and inhibition due to the threat-idea of such play consequences. This 
          can mean that, although &quot;value added&quot; refers to the additional 
          value created through <a href="http://users.pandora.be/Tango-E-Vita/tango/fashion.htm" title="self_advertising_culture_auto_promotion" target="_blank">image</a> 
          and marketing, there is a bodily surplus-value in tangodance. <br>

        &nbsp; The physical effort to create sound is part of the music. Even 
        when listening to sounds of musical instruments, a part of the listening 
        experience is a notion of the bodily activities that produce the sounds. 
        A player's sense of a musical style is primarily felt in contact with 
        the instrument. The bandone&oacute;n, originally ment as a small church 
        organ, needs the musician's whole body to express a boundary-transcending 
        sound. A musician is expressing himself through his instrument and connecting 
        awareness to the whole body. To realise the desire of bodily expressing 
        the music, to turn it into a real event, <strong>energetic input is needed</strong>. 
        Appasionato literally translates to &quot;impassioned,&quot; played with 
        passion and enthusiasm; the piece is not usually happy, but intense, characterized 
        by intense emotion, emotionally charged and vigorously energetic. In couple 
        dance, <strong>bodily contact means energy</strong>. Corporality with 
        it's energetic input, bodily, corporal or corporeal, is an important factor 
        that explains the extent to which a sensory experience will appear as 
        being truly sensory. The movement power is generated from the lower abdomen 
        and legs. Upper body strength and muscle-tonus extent the act of expressing 
        the music, expressing it with a stream of enegy waves. <BR>

        &nbsp; Through this bodiliness or corporeality, the twitch of a muscle 
        produces a change in the signal coming from your partner, moving your 
        body will immediately affect your partner. Because any change affects 
        the sensory input, t<em>he other person is forcibly present</em>. Bodiliness 
        is one aspect of sensory stimulation which makes it different from other 
        forms of stimulation, giving it an intimate quality. From this follows 
        the realness of the ongoing experience. Ongoingness means that an experience 
        is experienced as occurring to me, or happening to me here, now. Someone 
        is aware of an experience because he is interacting with it in a conscious 
        way. In a pair dance, partners need each other energy to make it real. 
        Couple dance is about sensitivity, intensity, mutual understanding and 
        <strong>partnership</strong>. <br>

        <br>
        &nbsp; Music is like sculpture. Not personal, we know that it cannot really 
        be emotional. None-the-less, music is for no one completely emotional 
        neutral. It can produce various emotional responses in different individuals 
        and even different responses in the same person at different times. Some 
        music expresses emotions so forcefully that we are evolved into it, it 
        is no longer a passive music experience. The more we are touched by the 
        spirit of the music, the more we are undergoing a deeply emotional story. 
        These compelling, often overwhelming, feelings, emerging seemingly from 
        nowhere, color our moods, affect our perceptions, and can alter our behavior. 
        <em>Music's emotional power arouses a physical experience.</em> <br>
        &nbsp; As the musical experiences vary, so too do the emotional or sensual 
        concepts. We can only acknowledge concepts of sensory experiences, let's 
        say like jealousy, when we are familiar with the experience, familiar 
        with a feeling of jealous envy, from inside out. If jealousy or passion 
        is unfamiliar to us, then there is a gap between the feeling and the concept. 
        The content is missing. But as we can see jealous people, we can <em>act 
        as seen</em>, but the gap is obvious for those who are familiar with the 
        emotional experience. Obviously, a starting point is being conscious and 
        becoming aware of something missing in relation to the music, a blind 
        spot about which one is <em>prejudiced</em> or ignorant, leading to a 
        deeply sensitive tango.<br>
        <br>
        <font color="#CC0000" size="4"> <strong>Tangoing between musicality and 
        choreography </strong> </font><br>
        <br>
        &nbsp; Regarding dancing tango and it's musical evolution in the recent 
        <a href="http://www.tangocd.com/" title="Tangos_by_decade" target="_blank">decades</a>, 
        the four representative schools of the Argentine tangomusic are: Di Sarli, 
        D&#8217;Arienzo, Troilo and Pugliese. They are dance orchestras, playing 
        music for dancing. When the spirit of the music is characterized by counterpoint 
        marking, clarity in the articulation is needed. It has a clear, repetitive 
        pulse or beat, a strong tango-rhythm which is based on the 2x4, 2 strong 
        beats on 4 (dos por cuatro). <em>Caminar es todo</em>, stepping the rhythm 
        is the art of tangoing. The dancer's <em>musicality</em> and his taste 
        for subtleties makes you see the refinement of the 2x4 tangomusic. Astor 
        Piazzolla stretched the classical harmony and counterpoint and moved the 
        tango from the dance floor to the concert stage. His <em>tango nuevo</em> 
        compositions tell us something of our contemporary life, dancing it relates 
        much to <a href="http://users.pandora.be/Tango-E-Vita/tangoiste/TANGOkinesis.htm" title="TANGOkinesis_Ana_María_Stekelman" target="_blank">modern 
        dance </a>which is a more <em>choreographic</em> performance. Tango with 
        a touch of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIMNfJtUTvo" title="bajo fondo tango club en méxico" target="_blank">techno</a> 
        is another new development. This <em>bajo fondo</em> underground tango 
        is, in a way, the return of the strong beat and it is mostly danced with 
        a lot of <em>nuevo</em> figures such as colgadas and <a href="http://users.pandora.be/Tango-E-Vita/tangoiste/tangolessen/volcada.htm" title="Volcada_Volcar_volcado" target="_blank">volcadas</a>. 
        In any case, musicality only comes when you love the music and know it 
        by heart. <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp; A pianist says: &quot;There&#8217;s nothing quite like learning 
        to play a piece of music to really get inside it. Once I&#8217;m inside 
        it, once I&#8217;m feeling through the piece with my own hands and working 
        through its many parts with the microscope of learning, once I really 
        start to &#8220;get it&#8221; about the music &#8230; it&#8217;s just 
        staggering.&quot; <br>
        <br>
        <font color="#CC0000" size="4"> <strong>The male dancer </strong> </font><br>
        <br>
        &nbsp; Leading and following is a mutual, energetic conversation. It is 
        a challenge, the idea of the picture is to capture all the pieces. Modern 
        western men may find it uncanny to step out the corner and to guide &quot;the 
        direction&quot; in a self-confident, dominant or socalled macho manner. 
        For years, the man's dancing role is directed into something like &quot;An 
        Officer and a Gentleman&quot;, which is in some way the classical dance 
        picture. In traditional ballets, the male dancer was secondary to the 
        ballerina. His job was primarily to lift the ballerina and support her 
        balance without drawing attention to himself. Breaking with tradition, 
        <strong>Rudolf Nureyev</strong> (1938-1993) reinvented the role of the 
        male in ballet. As a dancer he started early and conscientiously developing 
        the possibilities available to male dancers, proving that a principal 
        dancer can be just as gracefully subtle and expressive as a ballerina 
        without any loss of virility. <BR>
        <BR>
         
<object width="425px" height="360px" ><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><param name="wmode" value="transparent"/><param name="movie" value="http://mediaservices.myspace.com/services/media/embed.aspx/m=3306682,t=1,mt=video"/><embed src="http://mediaservices.myspace.com/services/media/embed.aspx/m=3306682,t=1,mt=video" width="425" height="360" allowFullScreen="true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent"></embed></object>


         <BR>
        <BR>
        One of the secrets of Nurejev&#8217;s success comes from the fact that 
        he did more than was necessary in everything he undertook. Rudolf Nureyev 
        made a great contribution to the reappraisal of male ballet and, by working 
        with contemporary choreographers, went far beyond the &quot;classical 
        / modern&quot; divisions. He was always attracted to difficulty: How could 
        I dance if I didn&#8217;t force myself to do things that I can&#8217;t 
        do? Rudolf Nureyev personified the school of life for a dancer: enrich 
        yourself, open up your mind, look all around, take it all in, and put 
        yourself in the position of understanding and interpreting the choreography, 
        not just performing it. Nurejev danced with impressive athletic power 
        and gained prominence for the male dancer at least equal to that of the 
        ballerina. <br>

        <br>
        &nbsp; Onstage, the phenomenal Fonteyn-Nureyev partnership set a standard 
        for ballet that is still alive today. <strong>Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf 
        Nureyev </strong>transformed the pas de deux (dance for two), which is 
        the centerpiece of traditional 19th century ballets. Instead of dancing 
        the pas de deux as a cool, technical display in which the ballerina was 
        the focal point, they created an intimate and intense drama in which the 
        danseur (the principal male dancer) and the ballerina contributed equally. 
        When Fonteyn and Noureev performed, there was electricity between them, 
        both had the gift of translating emotion into movement - the very basis 
        of their art. The tension arising from the 20 year gap in their ages, 
        their opposing temperaments and their totally diverse backgrounds seemed 
        to generate an electricity in the atmosphere whenever they appeared together, 
        and Fonteyn - far from being overshadowed - seemed rejuvenated, even her 
        technique seemed to improve. Margot Fonteyn could make you cry just watching 
        her. How to put something so visual, so potent with theatrical moment 
        that even film cannot capture it, into plain words? How to explain why 
        it is that when, to a particular strain of music, an ordinary mortal steps 
        forward on one leg, raises the other behind her and lifts her arms above 
        her head, the angels hold their breath? Meredith Daneman locates Fonteyn&#8217;s 
        extraordinary on-stage appeal in the woman&#8217;s personal qualities 
        - her moral as much as physical virtues. Fonteyn&#8217;s dark, exotic 
        looks came from her mother&#8217;s side of the family. Her father, Felix 
        Hookham, was a lower-middle-class Englishman; her mother the illegitimate 
        daughter of a rich Brazilian businessman, Antonio Goncalvez Fontes, and 
        an Irishwoman, Evelyn Acheson. When Daneman met members of the Fontes 
        clan in Brazil, she understood how Latin family pride had made it unthinkable 
        that a young dancer, Peggy Hookham, a remote relative, should adopt their 
        name as a stage pseudonym. She altered it instead to Fonteyn. The English 
        style of dancing was formed on and by Fonteyn, moulded by Frederick Ashton, 
        the choreographer who made the most of her talents. Ashton&#8217;s early 
        roles for Fonteyn show her as a sensual being: the seductive Creole girl 
        in Rio Grande, Tiresias the sexual experimenter. Then he froze her in 
        perpetual purity: Chloe, Ondine, Sylvia, in his postwar ballets, are maidens 
        beyond reproach. Not until Rudolf Nureyev burst onto the scene was Fonteyn 
        able to be anything other than virginal.<br>

        &nbsp; When the act of dancing is reduced to its elegant and stylish visual 
        image, it is as making a split between mind and body. Visual channels 
        only perceive visual phenomena, which is a concept for virtual reality, 
        as if sensory illusions are just like real life but somehow better. In 
        dance communication, pulses touch all senses, feelings are explored and 
        experienced by the own body. One can recognize it if one knows it. The 
        key is body knowledge. Raja Amari's movie <A target=_blank title="Raja_Amari_SatinRouge_Satin_Rouge_Movie_Trailer_Danseuse_Cabaret_movieclip_website" href="http://www.diaphana.fr/satinrouge/"> 
        <strong>Satin&nbsp;Rouge</strong></A> touches in a subtle way the ambiguity 
        of acting out reality in front of viewers, without any attempt at concealment 
        as if not aware of the observation. As the performing arts uses the artist's 
        own body as a medium, the exhibit can also be called entertainment or 
        a complete misconduct in a fictional frame. Bodily postures express, reinforce 
        and challenge inner attitudes and the audience features as a participant. 
        It offers an entry to another world. This opposition between the public 
        and private sphere creates a tension. It is obvious, a <em>dynamic duality</em>.

        <br>
        &nbsp; Nada hay tan &iacute;ntimo y p&uacute;blico a la vez&#8230; como 
        bailar. El tango, como toda manifestaci&oacute;n popular, nace espont&aacute;neamente 
        en Argentina, resultado de la necesidad de expresi&oacute;n del pueblo, 
        a fines de la d&eacute;cada de 1870. Es el lenguaje del cuerpo que permite 
        al alma expresar sus sentimientos, pasi&oacute;n y fuerza que crea y se 
        recrea en la belleza y la din&aacute;mica del movimiento. Fuertes emociones, 
        en particular, que llevan a los &oacute;rganos a un punto de exaltaci&oacute;n 
        que espont&aacute;neamente se manifiesta a si mismo a trav&eacute;s de 
        movimientos m&aacute;s o menos r&iacute;tmicos que constituyen lo que 
        se podr&iacute;a considerar como danzas naturales. Las expresiones espontaneas, 
        como tambien el arte de bailar, pueden ser descritos como <em>una expresi&oacute;n 
        de los sentimientos por medio de los movimientos del cuerpo mas o menos 
        controlados por el propio sentido r&iacute;tmico</em>. El baile, como 
        arte era utilizado para varios prop&oacute;sitos. El arte existe en todos 
        lados de la ciudad y en formas infinitas. <br>
        &nbsp; Entre 1900 y 1910 ese incipiente tango que se expresaba en prost&iacute;bulos 
        y arrabales de las afueras de la ciudad, empez&oacute; lentamente a ganar 
        terreno en los cabarets y peque&ntilde;os teatros de Buenos Aires. De 
        sus origines el tango fue una expresi&oacute;n cultural degenerado muy 
        particular a la situaci&oacute;n social Argentina, pero cuando el tango 
        fue aprobado al exterior se convirti&oacute; de repente en una imagen 
        de la identidad nacional. Igualmente, se concretan ciertos s&iacute;mbolos 
        sociales que pasar&aacute;n a formar parte del folklore ciudadano. Para 
        los &eacute;lites Argentinos el tango todav&iacute;a pertenec&iacute;a 
        a otro sector de la sociedad, y implicaba una identidad ajena de los inmigrantes, 
        los guapos, las prostitutas y todo un mundo nocturnal y peligroso de la 
        calle. La m&uacute;sica es otra forma de arte que es muy importante en 
        la cultura argentina. Muchos argentinos hablan de ella con tanta pasi&oacute;n 
        y orgullo. La historia del tango entra as&iacute; en un contexto m&aacute;s 
        amplio de historia de gente exiliada y ileg&iacute;tima en b&uacute;squeda 
        de una identidad propia, reconocimiento y dignidad. <br>
        &nbsp; La sensualidad del tango, la conexi&oacute;n corporal, puede ser 
        muy pesada, apasionada, y seria. En el tango no exist&iacute;a la regularidad 
        de las viejas danzas como el vals o la polca y por eso fue necesario creer 
        una t&eacute;cnica en la cual la pareja pod&iacute;a realizar una figura 
        en el momento sin anticipaci&oacute;n. El lugar donde se desarroll&oacute; 
        m&aacute;s el tango al principio del sigo XX fue dentro de las burdeles 
        donde los hombres bailaban en una forma mucho m&aacute;s sensual que permitir&iacute;an 
        las estrictas reglas sociales de la sociedad respetuosa. La mujer ten&iacute;a 
        que seguir siempre el hombre paso por paso movi&eacute;ndose con sus caprichos 
        y as&iacute; se fue formando la estructura de la danza que se sigue bailando 
        hoy en d&iacute;a. En un baile tan &iacute;ntimo, no se puede bailar con 
        cualquier hombre. As&iacute; que la mirada tiene un papel muy importante 
        en la cultura del tango. La mirada en el baile es intima pero liviana. 
        La mirada tambi&eacute;n existe en relaci&oacute;n al publico, que est&aacute; 
        siempre presente en los milongas. El tango es como un espejo, en su capacidad 
        de reflejar todo el desarrollo de una identidad social y relaciones sociales.

        <br>
        &nbsp; <em><strong>Pulsatie:</strong></em> Het bespelen van de bandone&oacute;n 
        vraagt een lichamelijke kracht, vergelijkbaar met slagwerk bij de opzwepende 
        Candombe-trommels of het aanslaan van pianotoetsen bij Rachmaninov 3. 
        <br>
        De<strong><font size="3"> organische golven</font></strong> van deze fysieke 
        inzet gaan doorheen het ritme en brengen het geheel tot leven. Deze dynamiek 
        weerspiegelt zich in het dansen en is al in het lichaam aktief voor de 
        beweging zichtbaar wordt. In een stilstaande abrazo zit veel dynamische 
        energie, dit moment van verstrengelde immobiliteit is een overgangsfase 
        naar een nieuwe biologische impuls. De drang om te dansen is een fysieke 
        nood. Een stap is meer dan een stap. Dit palet van energetische golfbewegingen 
        geven de dans diepte, zoals de muzikale kleuren bij Chopin of Jean-Yves 
        Thibaudet's <em>&quot;tr&egrave;s &agrave; l'aise-toucher&quot;</em> bij 
        Erik Satie. <br>
        <br>
        Muziek heeft de <strong><font size="3">kracht</font></strong> om uniek 
        contact te maken met jezelf en de ander. Tangodans is samen in één lichaam 
        zijn, en dansen met vier benen. In Argentijnse tango is de manier van 
        stappen een filosofisch gebeuren. Het is een verplaatsing van <em>energetische 
        golven</em>. De dans is onstaan in een milieu van messengevechten, een 
        gevechtskunst waarin de wijze van stappen levensbelangrijk is. De focus 
        is gericht op de partner. Ballroom salondansen hebben een andere, meer 
        aristokratische achtergrond en de focus is meer gericht naar de toeschouwers, 
        het maken van een vorstelijke indruk. <br>
        <font size="3"><strong>Bewegingszin</strong></font> vraagt een onderzoek 
        naar hoe je een beweging doet, of hoe iemand anders een beweging uitvoert. 
        Een beweging wordt meest als ‘juist’ beoordeeld wanneer het een vertrouwde 
        beweging is maar, zoals alle zintuigen, de bewegingszin is niet altijd 
        onfeilbaar. Om een goede coördinatie te vinden, leidt het tot niets om 
        een beweging te ‘verbeteren’ door er gewoon een andere voor in de plaats 
        te stellen. Herken, voel de verkeerde, overbodige spierinspanningen, maak 
        het onbewuste gedrag bewust en dan gebeurt het juiste uit zichzelf, als 
        in een aha-erlebnis. We zijn gewend om de vorm voornamelijk via de ogen 
        op te nemen. Door goed te kijken kunnen we innerlijk meebewegen met de 
        vormen, kan zelfs onze tastzin geactiveerd worden en als het ware de spanningen 
        in het beeld voelen. Maar het werkt nog beter in de andere richting: we 
        kunnen uitgaan van de bewegingszin en de tastzin en vanuit deze zintuigindrukken 
        het beeld proberen te begrijpen. Beeldvorming rond dansexpressie die zich 
        vanuit <em>tactiele waarneming </em>ontwikkelt heeft een groter vermogen 
        om innerlijk 'bewogen' te raken. Leren tijd nemen is hierin fundamenteel. 
        Zo komt men steeds dichter bij een neutrale toestand, een innerlijke rust 
        van waaruit het evenwichtige groeit. <br>

        &nbsp;<font size="3"><strong>Danser est un besoin physique.</strong></font>&nbsp; 
        Pour être bien en relation avec la musique du tango, il faut prendre pour 
        repère de son mouvement la pulsation du bandoneón. Rien de plus facile, 
        quand on écoute une musique, on tape souvent du pied d'une façon régulière 
        et répétitive et bien c'est la pulsation.<br>
        En général, il est bien et plus simple de bouger ses jambes sur cette 
        pulsation, cela nous permet d'être toujours en accord avec la musique. 
        On sait donc maintenant quand bouger ses jambes mais l'essentiel est de 
        savoir comment bouger. <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;Les dynamiques qui se construisent dans la danse, fonctionnent &agrave; 
        la fois comme des points (les centres de la pulsation) et comme des ondes 
        (le mouvement de la <strong>pulsation</strong>), ce qui est tr&egrave;s 
        pr&eacute;cis&eacute;ment ce que les physiciens appellent un fonctionnement 
        paradoxal. <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;Immobilit&eacute; n'est pas l'absence de tout mouvement : elle cache 
        en elle une complexit&eacute; inou&iuml;e de mouvements imbriqu&eacute;s 
        les uns dans les autres, chaque instant toutes les agitations qu'ils provoquent 
        s'annulent mutuellement &agrave; la perfection. Cette pulsation sym&eacute;trique 
        de construction et de destruction se fait n&eacute;cessairement &agrave; 
        partir de noeuds. Embrassements qui sont &agrave; la fois les centres 
        de convergence et les centres de divergence des ondes de construction 
        et de destruction, de telle sorte que l'ensemble fonctionne comme une 
        pulsation d'ondes stationnaires. Du fait de cette sym&eacute;trie parfaite, 
        les deux effets se neutralisent en permanence : plus rien ne bouge, plus 
        rien ne se passe. Les centres de pulsation stationnaire pourront servir 
        de &quot;points de d&eacute;part nou&eacute;s&quot; sur lesquels se construira 
        un nouveau cycle de complexit&eacute; progressive. Chacune des &eacute;tapes 
        d&eacute;bouchait sur une situation d&eacute;s&eacute;quilibr&eacute;e 
        qui, pour cette raison, basculait vers une nouvelle &eacute;tape de fonctionnement 
        lorsqu'elle &eacute;tait soumise &agrave; une impulsion plus forte &agrave; 
        laquelle elle n'&eacute;tait pas capable de faire face. <br>
        <br>
        Tout cela apporte un certain niveau d'excitation et m&ecirc;me quelques 
        mouvements violent, peut-&ecirc;tre une col&egrave;re. Il y a le machismo 
        ou viril macho et le tabou &eacute;vident entre un bien et une mauvaise 
        femme. Concernant le r&ocirc;le passif, il y a deux facteurs inhibiteurs 
        : celui qui repr&eacute;sente l'inhibition en raison de la menace d'&eacute;chec 
        de performance et de celui qui repr&eacute;sente l'inhibition en raison 
        de l'id&eacute;e de menace de telles cons&eacute;quences de jeu. Ou est 
        pas jouer aussi un jeu, des mannequins intouchables? Le rapport moderne 
        produit un esprit dans lequel l'acte de danse est r&eacute;duit dans les 
        mouvements m&eacute;caniques. Le but de cette &eacute;conomie de mouvement 
        n'est pas le vitalism du principe de plaisir, mais un produit de performance, 
        une attitude qui peut &ecirc;tre amusant aussi.<br>

        <font size="3"><strong>&nbsp;Il ballo &egrave; un bisogno fisico.</strong></font> 
        &nbsp;I dinamici che si costruiscono nella danza, funzionano allo stesso 
        tempo come punti (i centri della pulsazione) e come onde (il movimento 
        della <strong>pulsazione</strong>), cosa che &egrave; molto precisamente 
        ci&ograve; che i fisici chiamano un funzionamento paradossale. <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;Immobilit&agrave; n'est non l'absence di qualsiasi movimento: nasconde 
        in essa una complessit&agrave; inaudita di movimenti embricati gli uni 
        negli altri, ogni momento tutte le agitazioni qu'ils causano s'annulent 
        reciprocamente alla perfezione questa pulsazione simmetrica di costruzione 
        e di distruzione si fa necessariamente a partire da nodi. Abbracci che 
        sono allo stesso tempo i centri di convergenza ed i centri di divergenza 
        delle onde di costruzione e di distruzione, in modo che l'ensemble funzioni 
        come una pulsazione d'ondes stazionari. A causa di questa simmetria perfetta, 
        i due effetti si neutralizzano in modo permanente: pi&ugrave; nulla si 
        muove, pi&ugrave; nulla avviene i centri di pulsazione stazionaria potranno 
        fungere da &quot;points di partenza nou&eacute;s&quot; su quali si costruiranno 
        un nuovo ciclo di complessit&agrave; progressiva. Ogni tappa risultava 
        in una situazione squilibrata che, per questa ragione, oscillava verso 
        una nuova tappa di funzionamento lorsqu'elle era sottoposto ad un impulso 
        pi&ugrave; forte che n'&eacute;tait capace di affrontare. <br>
        <br>
        Tutto porta un determinato livello dell'eccitazione e perfino di alcuni 
        movimenti violenti, forse una certa rabbia. Ci &egrave; il machismo o 
        macho ed il taboo evidente fra una buona e donna difettosa. Per quanto 
        riguarda il ruolo passivo, ci sono due fattori inibitori: uno che rappresenta 
        l'inibizione dovuto la minaccia di guasto di prestazioni ed uno che rappresenta 
        l'inibizione dovuto l'minaccia-idea di tali conseguenze del gioco. O non 
        sta giocando, anche un gioco?<br>
        <br>
        L'obiettivo del tango sta svegliandosi che cosa molta gente ha all'interno 
        e trasforma esso nel ballo.<br>
        <br>
        <em>Spanish:</em><br>
        &nbsp; <font size="3"><strong>&nbsp;El tango es un diálogo entre los cuerpos</strong></font>, 
        la danza es una necesidad f&iacute;sica. La mente moderna produce una 
        mente en la cual el acto de baile es reducido en movimientos mec&aacute;nicos. 
        El objetivo de esta econom&iacute;a de movimiento no es el vitalism del 
        principio del arte de la vida, pero una exceso de producci&oacute;n, <em>nell'adempimento 
        dei suoi doveri</em>, un producto que puede ser la diversi&oacute;n tambi&eacute;n.<br>
        Las din&aacute;micas que son construidas en el baile, trabajan al mismo 
        tiempo como puntos (los centros del latido del coraz&oacute;n) y como 
        ondas (movimiento de <strong>pulsaci&oacute;n </strong>del coraz&oacute;n), 
        lo que es muy con precisi&oacute;n que el f&iacute;sico llaman un funcionamiento 
        parad&oacute;jico. <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;La inmovilidad no es la ausencia de ning&uacute;n movimiento: esto 
        esconde en ella una complejidad prodigiosa de movimientos traslapados. 
        La agitaci&oacute;n que ellos causan anula el uno al otro mutuamente en 
        la perfecci&oacute;n. Este latido del coraz&oacute;n sim&eacute;trico 
        de edificio y demolici&oacute;n es necesariamente hecho de nudos. Los 
        abrazos que son al mismo tiempo los centros de confluencia y los centros 
        de divergencia de ondas, de edificio y demolici&oacute;n, de modo que 
        esto trabaje como un latido del coraz&oacute;n de ondas inm&oacute;viles. 
        Debido a esta simetr&iacute;a perfecta, ambos efectos anulan el uno al 
        otro permanentemente: nada m&aacute;s movimientos, nada m&aacute;s ocurre. 
        Los centros del latido del coraz&oacute;n inm&oacute;vil ser&aacute;n 
        capaces de actuar como &quot; los puntos de la salida&quot; sobre que 
        ser&aacute; construido un nuevo ciclo de la complejidad progresiva. Cada 
        una de las etapas anteriores caus&oacute; una situaci&oacute;n desequilibrada 
        que, por esta raz&oacute;n, se cay&oacute; hacia una nueva etapa del funcionamiento, 
        porque fue sujetado a un empuje m&aacute;s fuerte. Incapaz de afrontar, 
        entonces las ondas frenan.<br>
        <br>
        Tango, pasi&oacute;n de Buenos Aires... para que puedan apreciar la verdadera 
        carne argentina. Todo esto trae un cierto nivel de la excitaci&oacute;n 
        y hasta algunos movimientos violentos, tal vez alguna c&oacute;lera. Hay 
        machismo o macho, y el tab&uacute; obvio entre un bueno y una mujer mala. 
        Acerca del papel pasivo, hay dos factores inhibitorios: uno que representa 
        la inhibici&oacute;n debido a la amenaza del fracaso de interpretaci&oacute;n 
        y uno que representa la inhibici&oacute;n debido a la idea de amenaza 
        de tales consecuencias de juego. &iquest;O no juega, tambi&eacute;n un 
        juego? <br>

        &nbsp;Tanz ist eine<strong><font size="3"> k&ouml;rperliche Notwendigkeit</font></strong>.&nbsp; 
        Das moderne Verh&auml;ltnis erzeugt eine Meinung, in der die Tat des Tanzens 
        in mechanische Bewegungen reduziert wird. Die Absicht dieser Bewegungswirtschaft 
        ist nicht der vitalism des Vergn&uuml;gen-Grundsatzes, aber einer Leistungsmeinung, 
        in Aus&uuml;bung seiner Pflicht, ein Produkt das auch lustig sein kann. 
        <br>
        Die Triebkr&auml;fte, die im Tanzen gebaut werden, arbeiten zur gleichen 
        Zeit als Punkte (Zentren des Herzschlags) und als Wellen (<strong>Herzschlag</strong>-Bewegung), 
        was sehr genau ist, dass der Physiker eine paradoxe Wirkung nennen.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;Unbeweglichkeit ist nicht die Abwesenheit jeder Bewegung: es verbirgt 
        in ihr einen erstaunlichen complicacy von &uuml;bergegriffenen Bewegungen. 
        Die Aufregung, die sie verursachen, annulliert einander gegenseitig in 
        der Vollkommenheit. Dieser symmetrische Herzschlag des Geb&auml;udes und 
        Abbruchs wird von Knoten notwendigerweise gemacht. Umarmungen, die zur 
        gleichen Zeit die Zentren der Menge und der Zentren der Abschweifung von 
        Wellen, des Geb&auml;udes und Abbruchs sind, so dass es als ein Herzschlag 
        von station&auml;ren Wellen arbeitet. Aufgrund dieser vollkommenen Symmetrie 
        annullieren beide Wirkungen einander permanent: nichts mehr Bewegungen, 
        nichts findet mehr statt. Die Zentren des station&auml;ren Herzschlags 
        werden im Stande sein, als &quot; Punkte des Weggangs&quot; zu handeln, 
        auf dem ein neuer Zyklus von progressivem complicacy gebaut wird. Jede 
        der vorherigen B&uuml;hnen lief auf eine unausgeglichene Situation hinaus, 
        welche aus diesem Grund zu einer neuen B&uuml;hne der Wirkung wackelte, 
        weil es einem st&auml;rkeren Impuls unterworfen wurde. Unf&auml;hig, so 
        ins Gesicht zu sehen, bremsen den Wellen.<br>
        <br>
        All das bringt ein gewisses Niveau der Erregung und sogar einige Blitzkrieg-Bewegungen. 
        Es gibt das Machismo oder Macho, und den offensichtlichen Tabu zwischen 
        einem Nutzen und einer schlechten Frau. Bez&uuml;glich der passiven Rolle 
        gibt es zwei hemmende Faktoren: derjenige, der Hemmung aufgrund der Drohung 
        des Leistungsmisserfolgs und desjenigen vertritt, der Hemmung aufgrund 
        der Drohungsidee von solchen Spiel-Folgen vertritt. Oder spielt, auch 
        ein Spiel nicht? <br>
        <br>
        Zieltango ... das Erwachen dass, was viele Menschen innen haben und es 
        in den Tanz umgestalten. <br>
        <br>
        <em>Em portugu&ecirc;s:</em><br>
        &nbsp;A dan&ccedil;a &eacute; uma<strong><font size="3"> necessidade f&iacute;sica</font></strong>.&nbsp; 
        A propor&ccedil;&atilde;o moderna produz uma mente na qual a a&ccedil;&atilde;o 
        da dan&ccedil;a &eacute; reduzida em movimentos mec&acirc;nicos. O gol 
        desta economia de movimento n&atilde;o &eacute; o vitalism do princ&iacute;pio 
        de prazer de viver, mas um produto de desempenho, uma atitude que pode 
        ser divers&atilde;o tamb&eacute;m. <br>
        As din&acirc;micas que s&atilde;o estruturadas na dan&ccedil;a, trabalham 
        ao mesmo tempo como pontos (os centros da batida do cora&ccedil;&atilde;o) 
        e como ondas (movimento de <strong>batida</strong> do cora&ccedil;&atilde;o), 
        o que &eacute; muito precisamente que a chamada de f&iacute;sico um funcionamento 
        paradoxal. <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;A imobilidade n&atilde;o &eacute; a aus&ecirc;ncia de nenhum movimento: 
        ele oculta nela uma complica&ccedil;&atilde;o prodigiosa de movimentos 
        ficados sobrepostos. A agita&ccedil;&atilde;o que eles causam reduze um 
        a outro mutuamente na perfei&ccedil;&atilde;o. Esta batida do cora&ccedil;&atilde;o 
        sim&eacute;trica de edif&iacute;cio e demoli&ccedil;&atilde;o &eacute; 
        necessariamente feita de n&oacute;s. Os abra&ccedil;os que s&atilde;o 
        ao mesmo tempo os centros da aflu&ecirc;ncia e os centros da diverg&ecirc;ncia 
        de ondas, de edif&iacute;cio e demoli&ccedil;&atilde;o, para que ele trabalhe 
        como uma batida do cora&ccedil;&atilde;o de ondas im&oacute;veis. Devido 
        a esta simetria perfeita, ambos os efeitos reduzem um a outro permanentemente: 
        nada mais movimentos, nada mais se realiza. Os centros da batida do cora&ccedil;&atilde;o 
        im&oacute;vel ser&atilde;o capazes de representar como &quot;os pontos 
        da partida &quot; sobre a qual ser&aacute; estruturado um novo ciclo da 
        complica&ccedil;&atilde;o progressiva. Cada uma das etapas anteriores 
        resultou em uma situa&ccedil;&atilde;o desequilibrada que, por essa raz&atilde;o, 
        tombou em dire&ccedil;&atilde;o a uma nova etapa do funcionamento, porque 
        foi submetido a uma impuls&atilde;o mais forte. Incapaz de defrontar, 
        portanto as ondas est&atilde;o freando.<br>
        &nbsp; Tudo ele traz certo n&iacute;vel da excita&ccedil;&atilde;o e at&eacute; 
        alguns movimentos violentos, talvez alguma raiva. H&aacute; machismo ou 
        macho, e a interdi&ccedil;&atilde;o &oacute;bvia entre um bom e uma m&aacute; 
        mulher. Dan&ccedil;arina e prostituta. Acerca da fun&ccedil;&atilde;o 
        passiva, h&aacute; dois fatores inibitivos: aquele que representa a inibi&ccedil;&atilde;o 
        devido &agrave; amea&ccedil;a do fracasso de performance e aquele que 
        representa a inibi&ccedil;&atilde;o devido &agrave; id&eacute;ia de amea&ccedil;a 
        de tais consequ&ecirc;ncias de jogo. Ou n&atilde;o est&aacute; jogando, 
        tamb&eacute;m um jogo? <br>
        O tango de objetivo ... despertamento que o que muitas pessoas t&ecirc;m 
        no interior e o transformam na dan&ccedil;a. <br>
        <br>
        Objetivo tango... despertamiento que lo que muchas personas tienen dentro 
        y lo transforman en el baile. <br>
