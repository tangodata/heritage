              <br>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; <EM>It is obvious that Argentine tango is a sensual 
              dance, but what is sensual? Is it the same as sexy? Or sensitive?</EM><BR>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; According to the dictionary, <EM>sensual</EM> is relating 
              to or affecting any of the senses or a sense organ; sensory. Sensuous: 
              highly appreciative of the pleasures of sensation. Sensual is all 
              that reports to a sense, all and everyone existing in human life. 
              Sensuality, also sensualness, means all that reports to any forms 
              of sense one that can recognize, say, “sense” it. <BR>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Sensualism</em> relates to the search for beauty, 
              amazing beauty, and the cruelty and pain that often accompanies 
              that beauty. In tango, Borges refers to the beauty of the panther, 
              the leopard or jaguar. Cruelty is a part of the beauty. <BR>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Sensuality </em>refers to subtle, <em>interior</em> 
              sensations. Such as, a tattooer who falls in love with a girl after 
              just seeing her foot, as in Junichiro Tanizaki’s story, "Shisei" 
              (<EM>Sisei, Si-Sei, The Tattooer, Tattoo, Irezumi</EM>). Much "sensuality" 
              can be found in Japanese literature: Yukio Mishima, Yasunari Kawabata, 
              Baku Akae. <BR>
              <BR>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; <EM>Sexyness</EM>, sexiness, sex appeal or being sexy 
              is about an <em>exterior</em> appearance. It can be related to self-perception, 
              self-awareness, self consciousness, ego. A feeling of self-consciousness 
              occurs when we realize that we are being watched or observed, the 
              feeling that "everyone is looking" at us. When feeling self-conscious, 
              one becomes aware of even the smallest of one's own actions, self-objectification. 
              Much of human sexual attractiveness is governed by physical attractiveness 
              which <em>Ariadne von Schirach</em> calls &quot;Der Tanz um die 
              Lust&quot;, wrapped up in desirability. Attractiveness involves 
              the impact one's appearance has on the senses, especially in the 
              beginning of a relationship: Visual perception (how the other looks). 
              Audition (how the other's voice sounds). Olfaction (how the other 
              smells, naturally or artificially; the wrong smell may be repulsive). 
              Olfactory signals, or smell, can influence the perception of attractiveness. 
              Physical attractiveness is the perception of the physical traits 
              of an individual human person or a group, race, or type of people, 
              as attractive or beautiful. <BR>
              <BR>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Sensitivity</em>, sensitiveness, sensible, sensibility: 
              mental responsiveness and awareness, refined sensitivity to pleasurable 
              or painful impressions. <em>Sensibility</em> seems to have a particular 
              literary sense, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. It refers 
              to a cluster of attributes, amongst which you can include the display 
              of &quot;elegant and graceful&quot; emotions and tastes, exhibiting 
              a careful attention to detail, etiquette. Hard to please, demanding.

            &nbsp; <strong>Sensuality</strong> refers to subtle sensations. Such 
            as, a tattooer who falls in love with a girl after just seeing her 
            foot. Junichiro Tanizaki&#8217;s story, &quot;Shisei&quot; (<em>Sisei, 
            Si-Sei, The Tattooer, Tattoo, Irezumi</em>) begins with the narrator 
            illustrating the ancient art of tattooing. He vividly describes that 
            Japanese men, who were performing in the Kabuki Theater, received 
            tattoos in order to satisfy their upper class audiences and enhance 
            their beauty. This story is about a young tattoo artist named Seikichi 
            who trained as an ukiyoye painter in his youth but dropped in social 
            status and became a renowned tattoo artist. For years, Seikichi perfected 
            his tattoo artistry on many clients. To him they were his body canvases 
            which came in all different shapes and sizes, but he yearned for something 
            more, he wanted the perfect canvas to paint his masterpiece on. Then 
            one day, while passing a restaurant, he caught a glimpse of a beautiful 
            woman&#8217;s foot and fell madly in love with her. A few days later, 
            the beautiful woman appeared at his door carrying a package from one 
            of Seikichi&#8217;s friends. He gazed at her beauty, she had the facial 
            features that he desired, and her body was the perfect canvas he wanted 
            to paint his greatest masterpiece on and then, the story starts. Jun'ichir&ocirc; 
            Tanizaki wants his readers to understand Seikichi&#8217;s stream of 
            consciousness and piece together the inner workings of an artist&#8217;s 
            mind. By doing this, Tanizaki reveals to his readers how art affects 
            an artist and how the love of art can lead to a man&#8217;s destruction. 
            <br><br>
            &nbsp; <strong>Junichiro Tanizaki</strong>'s (1886&#8211;1965) writing 
            is compelling: despite a straight-forward, precise writing style, 
            his stories are extremely<em> passionate, erotic, sensual, subversive, 
            spiritual, diabolic, fragile. </em>Tanizaki often writes of women, 
            taking as his themes obsessive love, the destructive forces of sexuality, 
            and the dual nature of woman as goddess and demon. Tanizaki sought 
            to create works of beauty through style and mood, inspired in part 
            by the Japanese past and also by certain Western writers such as Edgar 
            Allan Poe, Charles Baudelaire, and Oscar Wilde. Elected to the Japanese 
            Academy of Art in 1923 and decorated with the Order of Culture in 
            1949, Tanizaki occupied a position of eminence in the world of letters 
            for many years. Much more of this <strong>&quot;sensuality&quot;</strong> 
            can be found in Japanese literature: Yukio Mishima, Yasunari Kawabata 
            , Baku Akae. </font></div>

            <BR>
            &nbsp; When the child looks at his reflection in front of a mirror 
            (le stade du miroir), the reflected &quot;startling spectacle&quot; 
            establishes the idea of subjectivity or ego. At the age of six months, 
            the infant is introduced the idea of the difference between self / 
            other. The emphasis here is on the process of identification with 
            an outside image or entity that extends from a fragmented body-image 
            to a form of its <em>totality</em>. This is the start of a lifelong 
            process of identifying the self in terms of the Other. A perceptual 
            relationship to another of the same species is necessary in the normal 
            maturing process. Without the visual presence of others, the maturing 
            process is delayed. <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; Today, there is no shortage of visual presence of others, it's 
            an overwhelming cultural phenomenon. Faced with large social groupings 
            (big cities), multiple influences (media, advertising, peer group 
            and family pressures, social expectations), and fast moving technology 
            (internet, email, mobile phones, iPods), things are caused to go more 
            rapidly, speeded up or sexed up. Not only is the mirror on the wall 
            at home but media representations, conversations with friends and 
            other forms of social feedback interweave with one&#8217;s (dance) 
            life, one&#8217;s (self) perception and today's emphasis is on <em>the 
            visual image</em>. Are dancers too often working to achieve an image 
            of what they think dancing is, rather than achieving an understanding 
            and an experience of the dance? Is there a relation between the renewed 
            popular interest in dancing and today's longing, yearning and desire 
            to <a href="http://www.zonalatina.com/Zldata125.htm" title="zonalatina" target="_blank">stay 
            eternally young and beautiful</a>? Anyway, things are looking sexier 
            than ever.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; Is dancing an esthetic experience, a contemporary lifestyle? 
            One can say that significant interior feelings like joy, make an exterior 
            appearance meaningful. From <em>the interior feelings</em>, the dance 
            derives <em>its sense of motion as a whole</em>. To make dance a living, 
            ongoing event, there must be this, rather magical internal trigger 
            for action. It is like playing piano, it is not the same as typing 
            notes, an inner soul has to touch the fingers. A musician is expressing 
            himself through his instrument and connecting awareness to the whole 
            body. He is not unpacking a digital audio format. Dancing on life 
            music feels much different from a mp3 audio file which encodes music 
            into a technological form. We interact through all our senses, the 
            sensing body in movement has much more layers than a visual image 
            in a modern, virtual environment.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; Introspection captures the intention, not just the physical, 
            outward expression. Action only deals with physical movement: the 
            action line, the axis. Physical movement however, has a non-physical 
            counterpart: its essence, its movement identity. Gesture involves 
            not only physical movement, but a deeper concept of identity. One 
            can only make tactile contact if an appearance has a deeper emotional 
            substance, a lived-body is behind the appearance. Touching another 
            person is a form of physical intimacy and plays an important role 
            in dance. Bodiliness is the fact that when you move your body, incoming 
            sensory information immediately changes. Bodiliness is one aspect 
            of sensory stimulation which makes it different from other forms of 
            stimulation, and contributes to giving it its peculiar quality. Because 
            of bodiliness, corporeality, sensory information has an &quot;intimate&quot; 
            quality: it's almost as though it were part of your own body.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; Today's &quot;timespirit&quot; expresses a certain &quot;language&quot; 
            to act like the others in society, a drive to uniformity. That certain 
            &quot;language&quot; or &quot;La forza del destino&quot;, can be related 
            to self-objectification. It involves adopting a third-person perspective 
            on the physical self and constantly assessing one&#8217;s own body 
            in an effort to conform to the culture&#8217;s appearance ideal.&nbsp; 
            Objectification, the act of representing an abstraction as a physical 
            thing. Though portraying oneself solely as an object to be looked 
            at is sometimes viewed as exercising <em>control</em>, presentation 
            of the self in this way can be viewed as a form of self-objectification. 
            That is, they internalized an observer&#8217;s standard of appearance 
            and are engaged in activities designed to enhance their sexual attractiveness. 
            One can say that a catwalk is not about interior feelings. Studies 
            have demonstrated that girls and women self-objectify more than boys 
            and men do. Objectification will not affect all individuals equally, 
            but certain situations that accentuate a person's awareness of observers' 
            perspectives on their bodies are likely to enhance self-objectification. 
            One group that might be expected to be particularly high in self-objectification 
            are dancers. Most of the dancer&#8217;s time is spent in the studio 
            where the mirror is omnipresent. The dance room is incomplete without 
            a mirror. The mirror is objective. The mirror does not lie and it 
            is a constant reminder to the dancer of surveillance. <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; Of central importance to Objectification Theory, is that objectification 
            in our society influences people to internalise the views present 
            in society and to begin viewing themselves in the same way. That is, 
            girls and boys gradually learn to adopt an observer's perspective 
            on their physical selves and to treat themselves as an object to be 
            looked at and evaluated on the basis of appearance. Fredrickson and 
            Roberts (1997) term this particular perspective &quot;self-objectification,&quot; 
            and describe it as a form of self-consciousness that is characterised 
            by habitual and <em>constant self-monitoring of one's outward appearance 
            </em> to a prescribed ideal image. The constant monitoring of appearance 
            accompanying self-objectification has a number of negative behavioural 
            and experiential consequences. Internalising an observer's objectifying 
            perspective is <em>incompatible</em> with a creative, playful or attentive 
            state of mind. Further, habitual self-monitoring of outward appearance 
            results in a diminished awareness of internal body states. The attention 
            is turned away from the experience as a living, inner experience. 
            Selfobjectification diverts attention, with people monitoring their 
            own bodies as a reaction to (or in anticipation of) the objectifying 
            gaze of others (gaze anticipation). In a society in which the individual 
            is relentlessly confronted with a massive cultural production of unattainable 
            role models, we find ourselves increasingly under pressure to conform.

            &nbsp; The omnipresence of desirable bodies with luxurious lingerie 
            styling of the 1940's and the knowledge that we will never look like 
            that, creates a paradoxical and artificial web of frustration and 
            desire. This has created a completely new form of behavior which <em>Ariadne 
            von Schirach</em> calls &quot;Der Tanz um die Lust&quot;. Esthetic 
            withdrawal, wrapped up in desirability. In the past, women were supposed 
            to be pretty and men successful. Now, being young, attractive, verbal, 
            intelligent and successful, seems today for all to be the only way 
            to be. The pressure to satisfy and keep that goal, along with the 
            insecurity and stress it brings, has doubled. <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; In &quot;Mismatch, <em>Why Our World No Longer Fits Our Bodies</em>&quot; 
            , the authors Peter Gluckman and Mark Hanson raise questions about 
            the growing mismatch of biological maturity and psychosocial maturity 
            and its associated challenges to a society often slow to evolve its 
            own morals and expectations. Due to improved nutrition, girls are 
            now starting to menstruate as as young as 10 and 11, but may not become 
            emotionally and intellectually mature for another decade, causing 
            conflicts for teenagers, schools and parents. Over the past 50 years 
            the average age at which girls exhibit the first signs of puberty 
            has fallen to 8 years old. Meanwhile brain development - including 
            how to say no - is stuck where it always has been, around 16. The 
            problem is the same for boys: earlier puberty contrasted with static 
            brain development. Developed bodies and surging hormones crossed with 
            a world that treats them as children on one hand and constantly reminds 
            them of their sexuality on the other, adds up to the kind of frustration 
            you see every weekend at the city's shopping malls. Young people demand 
            freedom. Parents cling to control. Puberty is getting earlier at the 
            rate of a month's fall every two or three years. We now live with 
            a complexity that was never required before, which is compounded by 
            expectations and pressures that come from the impact of media. It's 
            also possible that the structures of society mean it actually takes 
            longer to mature as an adult. Society will get more complex, not less, 
            so children will take a long time to accumulate the life-skills to 
            be adults. The media will continue to drive messages to sell their 
            products based on reminding kids of their sexuality and their sex 
            maturation. We have created a modern, artificial world that is out 
            of tune with our evolved bodies. Our bodies have not yet evolved to 
            match the rapidly changing environment in the developed world. <br>

            Europeans who go to Buenos Aires to dance a passionate tango in the 
            milongas, may find the formal codes and behavior rules, such as the 
            strict separation between men, women and couples, a bit outdated. 
            Others will find it nostalgic, as if <strong>concealing mystic darkness</strong>, 
            as in the old days of Catholicism. <br>
            A history of social dance is a history of morality and as 83% of the 
            Argentinians are Catholics, it reflects some Catholic morality. A 
            Catholic morality with its restrictions and rebellions, such as between 
            the Catholic Church and the Liberation Theology. Admit, for a single 
            Catholic woman it isn&#8217;t always easy to make the step to tango 
            dancing, tango with it's, nearly sacramental, intimacy and passion. 
            But, quite true, dance portrays the beauty of the person as made in 
            the image of God. Regarding <em>Tango and the Theology of the Body</em>,

            <br>
            Buenos Aires is often called the Paris of South America, mainly because 
            of its architectural image. Regarding the man-woman relation however, 
            it is much different from the Parisian mind. The Argentine Catholic 
            church has focused its advocacy in three areas: ferm opposition to 
            nearly all forms of modern contraception, to sex education, and to 
            abortion. At the heart of this opposition lie views about women&#8217;s 
            role in the family, and about maternity and reproduction as key parts 
            of women&#8217;s identity. Increasingly, especially at the present 
            difficult economic situation in Argentina, Catholic church officials 
            have sought to justify their faith-based opposition to contraception 
            and abortion in less doctrinal and more &#8220;pragmatic&#8221; terms, 
            such as &#8220;scientific&#8221; proof that condoms prevent neither 
            pregnancy nor sexually transmitted infections or nationalist concerns 
            with population size and growth. Historically, a central part of the 
            identity of the political elite in Argentina has been that of a frontier 
            nation to be colonized and populated by Caucasian immigrants from 
            Europe. The most famous expression of this identity is the phrase 
            <em>to rule is to populate</em> attributed to Juan Bautista Alberdi, 
            a central figure in Argentina&#8217;s political history known as the 
            &#8220;father of the Argentine constitution.&#8221; Over the years, 
            the refrain to <em>rule is to populate</em> has been used by various 
            political actors to justify the limitations on women&#8217;s reproductive 
            autonomy and rights, by reference to women&#8217;s essential role 
            as childbearers and <em>as such</em> tools for population growth. 
            Across the South American region, many governments and legislators 
            have historically declared their opposition to modern birth control 
            methods, usually with reference to Catholic church doctrine. However, 
            in Argentina the government went so far as to prohibit the sale of 
            all contraceptives for several decades in the late twentieth century, 
            an extreme display of opposition to birth control even by regional 
            standards. This pro-natalist approach has historically set Argentina 
            apart from the rest of South America, so much so that Argentina in 
            1996 was the only country in the region to provide no public support 
            of any kind for access to contraception. <br>
            Only in <strong>2002 </strong>did the Argentine congress enact meaningful 
            reform, overcoming vocal opposition from the Catholic church as well 
            as several conservative legislators to pass the National Law on Sexual 
            Health and Responsible Procreation. This law placed reproductive and 
            sexual health on the national political agenda for the first time 
            in Argentina&#8217;s history. Argentina&#8217;s health minister indicated 
            publicly that he thought women&#8217;s health and lives probably would 
            improve if abortion were decriminalized. In response, President Nestor 
            Kirchner (elected in 2003) was quick to emphasize that the government&#8217;s 
            position continued to be a &#8220;clear rejection of the legalization 
            of abortion.&#8221; However, Kirchner also defended his government&#8217;s 
            health minister against subsequent attacks from the Catholic church, 
            including by asking the Vatican to retire a bishop who had suggested 
            the health minister should be thrown into the sea with a stone around 
            his neck for his comments.<br>

            <br>
            President N&eacute;stor Kirchner, while professing belief in the Catholic 
            faith, has often had a troubled relationship with the hierarchy of 
            the Church. Kirchner belongs to the center-left of Peronism and has 
            placed emphasis on certain progressive views that do not go well with 
            some conservative Catholics. The Argentine national government passed 
            laws and began a program to the effect of providing assistance on 
            sex education to all citizens, including the provision of free oral 
            contraceptives and condoms. The Church opposes artificial contraception 
            and has placed conditions on its acceptance of sex education in schools. 
            At the beginning of 2005, the minister of Health made public his support 
            for the legalization of abortion, and Kirchner's silence on the matter 
            angered the Church. In October 2005 conflict erupted again as the 
            Argentine Chamber of Deputies took steps to pass a Sex Education Law 
            that would encompass the whole school system (public and private, 
            including confessional schools), forcing educational establishments 
            to teach students about gender roles and contraception, among other 
            topics. The Archbishop of La Plata accused the state of &quot;promoting 
            sexual corruption&quot; and &quot;inciting fornication, lust and promiscuity&quot;. 
            On the issue of the 1970's, - the Vatican Embassy here kept a secret 
            list of thousands of people who &quot;disappeared&quot; during Argentina's 
            dirty wars of the late 1970s - Kirchner called attention on the many 
            bishops &quot;who weren't there while children were disappearing&quot; 
            and who &quot;gave [the sacrament of] confession to torturers&quot; 
            of the Dirty War. Members of the opposition later qualified Kirchner 
            as &quot;Liberation Theology&quot;, &quot;unjust&quot; and &quot;intolerant&quot;. 
            At the present time, old milonga codes are changing, and more. <br>
