<b>Is tango macho ?</b> <br><br>
Tango 
          is a very complicated dance, it tries to have two embracing bodies accomplish 
          figures. <br>
          In tango, two minds, not one, achieve fluid movement, so that each leg 
          and each hand fits into what the other legs and hands are doing in order 
          for the two to function as a single body. One body, two people and moreover, 
          the opposite sex...
<br><br>

            <br><br>
          So, two beings as different as a man and a woman, who often have never 
          before met, embrace one another and dance to the rhythm of the music, 
          creating a beautiful dance. <br>
          To be able to dance tangos the dancers must complement one another, they 
          must cooperate with one another. If they compete, if they fail to collaborate, 
          it is impossible for them to dance, or at least to dance well. <br>
          Thus, tango begins with an agreement between the dancers that the man 
          will lead. The two dancers coordinate and cooperate with each other 
          without losing their difference. Each dancer achieves something different. 
          And therein lies each one's position in the dance. What defines each 
          position is its technique and the task it perfoms, which are both necessary 
          for the dance to happen.<br><br>
          However, tango is a game like <strong>chess</strong>, in which each 
          piece moves according to standardized rules. A rook, for example, moves 
          at right angles, while a bishop moves diagonally. But both pieces, and 
          all the others, are necessary for the game to be played... and leading 
          is not the same as winning !<br><br>
          Similarly, to dance tango argentino and to enjoy doing so, each dancer has to 
          try to follow the rules pertaining to his or her position in the dance. 
          Thus, I am privileging the structure of the dance in this analysis, 
          and not the passions and emotions that circulate in that structure. 
          I believe that the passions and emotions are a consequence, an effect 
          of the game. <br><br>
          Playing the game well is a passion. Eric Berne, speaking of stimulus-hunger, 
          says that the most favoured forms of stimuli are those provided by physical 
          intimacy, ...and what is a close embrace ? No, we only do it for the 
          technique !<br><br>
          So, a good female milonga dancer knows how to let herself be led. She 
          accepts the invitation of a tanguero who dances well and she enjoys dancing 
          with him. Thanks to his sensitivity, his presence, and his confidence, 
          she can display her own style. If a woman lets a man express himself, 
          and the man lets the woman express herself, then they will both find 
          in tango an opportunity to be creative. <br><br>

          <strong>The dark side coexists in the lightest pieces </strong><br>
      <br>
          &nbsp; Nearly all live performances today desperately try to be replicas 
          (of fine recordings). And a fine recording by the current standard means 
          something that is relatively sympathetic, but flawless, smooth, and 
          straightforward, that does not breach any confidences, has no real conceits, 
          no dark sides, vulgarities, or metaphors -- everything that makes art 
          interesting. It isn't really fun to go to a performance where you are 
          assured that it is going to be flawless. Perfection, as Schoenberg pointed 
          out, is not a category of making music. Performances have to have some 
          danger. Baudelaire: &quot;In everything beautiful there is something 
          strange.&quot; Performances must have things that are surprising and 
          dark. <br>
           <br>
          &nbsp; <strong>Ludwig Van Beethoven</strong>'s driving music and its 
          association with dark fate has fascinated listeners for centuries. In 
          Beethoven's music, things are set up and then when you're not looking, 
          here comes a left hook. He trips you with his judo technique. It may 
          be conspicuous or it may be very covert, but the surprises are the tissue 
          of the music, and without them the music would be stationary, ordinary. 
          <strong>Surprises are built into the texture</strong>, but in such a 
          way that they seem absolutely necessary. Beethoven acknowledged his 
          own dark side. &quot;Next to love, the best things in life are surprises&quot;, 
          he said. While Beethoven's earlier pieces being light entertainment 
          are no more challenging then the pop music of today for its audiences. 
          By the time we get to the five movements of &quot;String Quartet No 
          15 in A minor, Op.132 &quot;, the increased complexity of the music 
          becomes obvious. We've travelled the equivalent distance of moving from 
          cheap sentimentality to the real emotion of Sylvia Plath's intensity. 
          <br>
           <br>
      &nbsp; Plato said, &quot;There are no serious things without laughable things.&quot; 
      Dark and funny, mischievous and burlesque -- all of those qualities are 
      there in Beethoven. It's the vast range and variety of characters in the 
      music that makes him another Shakespeare. The first movement of Op. 90 is 
      immensely dark. The &quot;Appassionata&quot; is tormented, grieving, and 
      desolate. In Liszt, love and 
      diabolism make a natural dichotomy. While Don Juan is an erotic force, Liszt 
      seizes on his innate diabolism as a source of inspiration, recalling that 
      it is for blasphemy that Don Juan is dragged to Hell by the ghost of the 
      man he slew in a duel of honor and outrage. There are examples all over -- and in the tissue and grain of 
      the music, even the happy music. But then, Mozart has a very dark side, 
      too. And the dark side coexists in the lightest pieces. <br> <br>

        Scraped flat by the roller<br />
        Of wars, wars, wars.<br />
        But the name of the town is common.<br />

        <br />
        Bit my pretty red heart in two.<br />
        I was ten when they buried you.<br />
        At twenty I tried to die<br />
        And get back, back, back to you.<br />
        I thought even the bones would do.<br />
        <br />
        But they pulled me out of the sack,<br />
        And they stuck me together with glue.<br />
        And then I knew what to do.<br />
        I made a model of you,<br />
        A man in black with a Meinkampf look<br />
        <br />
        And a love of the rack and the screw.<br />

          "Daddy" - Sylvia Plath Poems<br>
          </strong><br>
          The title of "Daddy" means relationship between father and girl. Plath 
          wrote this poem when she divorced her husband, so there are three people 
          - Plath, her father and her husband in this poem. For example, in the 
          ninth stanza 'If I've killed one man, I've killed two' means her father 
          and her husband. This poem may mean relationship between woman and man 
          or the weak and the strong.<br>
          In the second stanza 'Daddy, I have had to kill you. You died before 
          I had time-', her father forsook her by his death. In this poem 'God, 
          Luftwaffe, black man and devil' mean her father. He was very big and 
          very strong in her mind. She could not escape FROM him. She hated him, 
          but she loved him. In the seventh stanza 'At twenty I tried to die and 
          get back, back, back to you' SHOW me it. She was very shocked by his 
          death. It is may be that she wrote this poem to get over her sorrow 
          and anger or release FROM him.<br>
          A conclusion, she tried to kill her father and her husband to release 
          FROM strong them in her mind. But in sixth stanza 'Every woman adores 
          a Fascist' mean that she loves them. I think she wants to be strong 
          like them. In final stanza 'I'm through'means two things. One meaning 
          is finishing revenge against her father's death. Another meaning is 
          death of Plath. She needed her death to release FROM them. <br>Women...</font></p>

          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
            The speaker in this poem is a daughter who has an Electra complex. 
            Her father died while she believed him as the God. Her circumstances 
            are complicated. This is because her father is a member of Nazi and 
            surely her mother has Jewish blood in her vein.<br>
            I dont know how I can receive her explanation, but I think it is 
            all right to take her biographic fact in consideration to some extent 
            in interpreting this poem.<br>
            The poem begins with a series of metaphors about Plaths father. They 
            are, for example, shoe -statue - foot -root - , which means her love 
            to him like the God, but gradually the metaphors comes to mean her 
            hate to him like the Satan. They are, for example, a brute,a devil. 
            Near the end, a new metaphor comes out. It is about her husband, Ted 
            Hughes, for instance vampire.</font></p>

      <b>Sylvia - The Movie</b><br>
      <b>Director:</b> Christine Jeffs<BR>
      <b>Cast:</b> Gwyneth Paltrow, Daniel Craig, Jared Harris, Blythe Danner, 
      Amira Casar, Lucy Davenport, Michael Gambon, Eliza Wade<BR>
      <br>
      "Dying is an art," are the first words uttered in Christine Jeffs biopic 
      Sylvia, but its tough to say that the film agrees. At least to the degree 
      that Jeffs finds art in Sylvia Plaths death, she finds tragedy and waste. 
      The film strikes an even-handed tone that, while still respecting the legend 
      that Plath (Gwyneth Paltrow) would posthumously become, refuses to glorify 
      the authors suffering. After all, to glorify her as a Nietschen artist 
      that needed to suffer to create, it would need to let us get closer to than 
      it ever does. Everything in this sometimes inscrutable movie resists pigeonholing. 
      Even the opening credits, which place white titles a classy font on a black 
      background, slowly and subtly pull away from us as we read them. When the 
      camera finally moves back toward the action, and slowly zooms closer to 
      Sylvia, we see her reading a poem by her future husband, Ted Hughes (Daniel 
      Craig). This makes sense, since for the first half of Sylvia, at least, 
      its Hughes observation of his wife that helps us get closer to her. <br>
      Hughes and Plath share a tumultuous romance that begins predictably, if 
      in a manner more highbrow than usual. During their brief courtship, these 
      literary minds prattle off poetry at a rapid pace and voraciously quote 
      Chaucer and Romeo and Juliet (the death scene, of course) at one another. 
      Its not long, however, before cracks in their relationship begin to show. 
      Sylvia becomes increasingly suspicious of her womanising husband. More troubling 
      still, is Teds rising awareness of his wifes mental instability. <br>
      The film details the dynamics of both their attraction to and repulsion 
      from one another with an unusual degree of sensitivity. Never does it feel 
      like Plaths condition is being exploited to create headier drama. Theres 
      a well-staged scene where Plaths mother (played by Paltrows real life 
      mother Blythe Danner) tells Hughes to "Be good to her, always". That statement 
      sounds like nothing less than a warning, yet the film thankfully doesnt 
      posit that Hughes poor treatment of his wife is the main catalyst in her 
      self-destruction. <br>

      <strong>Still much is unknown about the Universe. </strong>Dark matter and 
      dark energy compose about 95% of it, shining stars and planets are only 
      a little part of the the atmosphere. The relationship between dark and luminous 
      is a clustering one. Clustering of luminous matters like galaxies, corresponds 
      to dark matter clustering. <strong>Clothing in tango </strong>is mostly 
      black, combined with serious faces and the sad organ-like sound of the bandoneon 
      does make the atmosphere mystic. Black evokes dignity, power and even threat. 
      Black is the symbol of authority and its severity is often used in a persuasion 
      strategy to portray a seriousness. Dark clothing has the practical benefit 
      that transpiration marks are less visible. The darkness of the black dressed
