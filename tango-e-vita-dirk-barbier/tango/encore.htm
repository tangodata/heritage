            &nbsp; <strong><em>Tango dance </em></strong><em>as had many forms

            disappearing as if driven out of existence by identifiable external

            <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; The story of tango is part of the urban changes that turned 
            Buenos Aires into a metropolis. As the city began to expand with &quot;los 
            barrios&quot; or districts, new career paths made it possible to move 
            up the social ladder. In a relatively short time, the Buenosairean 
            society was diversified and became more complex. Between end of the 
            first decade of the 20'th century and the 1940's, people of the districts 
            began to frequent &quot;los caf&eacute;s&quot; or coffee houses and 
            <a href="http://www.todotango.com/english/biblioteca/cronicas/cabarets.asp" title="Tabaris_Marabú_Casanova_Chanteclair_Tibidabo_Bambú_40s" target="_blank">cabarets</a> 
            in the buenosaires center, and politicians looking for votes walked 
            the districts making political campaigns. The extension of the free 
            time outside the family homeworld, offered to many new encounters 
            with great opportunities. A new, consuming public was profiling, common 
            people, of the districts, that listened to tangos and danced, read 
            newspapers, magazines and went to the cinema, frequented new socialization 
            fields, from the local club to the &quot;society of promotion&quot; 
            and the bar. The result of this embourgeoisement or aburguesuamento, 
            is that more people are incorporated into the middle-class. The expansion 
            of the transport network facilitated an endless number of interchanges 
            between the world of the districts and the center. Buenos Aires had 
            not only grown but was also more communicated. The mainstreet in the 
            heart of the city, &quot;La calle Corrientes&quot;, became the &quot;neutral 
            territory&quot; or &quot;abstract space&quot; on which the culture 
            of the center and the one of the districts &quot;were to taste&quot;. 
            <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; Through time, as the male / female population balance was getting 
            more equal in Buenos Aires, dating became more normal and the scene 
            changed. Now, both men and women went to crowded tango dancehalls 
            and confiter&iacute;as, where they danced very close, the woman&#8217;s 
            head over her partner&#8217;s right shoulder, so he could whisper 
            in her ear and visa versa, this romantic &quot;cheek to cheek-style&quot; 
            was called apilado, piled up, packed tightly together. Later, with 
            the appearance of the tango in the milonga danceclubs and the sal&oacute;n 
            in the family houses, the tanguero public transformed. From 1940, 
            the tango had to express something else than the eroticism of the 
            bordelles and cabarets louche. The aesthetic focus was no longer on 
            sexual desire and carnal pleasures but on the elegant appearance. 
            And as the social setting changed, what about the magnetic material 
            inside tangodance, did the original intent become uncertain? Did the 
            spirit remain or is the forbidden dance merchandised? Is it been translated 
            by the media, by stereotyping, by anyone wanting to do it. They say 
            that the moment you start commercialising, you kill something, becoming 
            a marketing practice in which the image is used to sell. <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; Since the First World War, the period in which tango became 
            a worldwide phenomenon, Buenos Aires and the rest of the world underwent 
            a transformation. Seen through the eye of urbanization, it looks as 
            if it was rescued from a dubious past of red-light districts with 
            gambling, champagne and cocaine. The World War and the industrial 
            age changed also much of what we assume to be the <strong>personal 
            self</strong>. That transformation of the personal self is, especially 
            in the last decade, still increasing and influencing public perceptions. 
            Today, we are not in &quot;Les ann&eacute;es folles&quot;. Today's 
            &quot;timespirit&quot; expresses a certain &#8220;language&#8221; 
            to act like the others in society. Sameness or similarity tend to 
            be perceived as belonging together, making it a safe unit. But it 
            is more than a drive or tendency to uniformity, it is self-objectification, 
            a form of self-consciousness that is characterised by constant self-monitoring 
            of one's outward appearance to a prescribed ideal image. With each 
            group that is assimilated, a culture vanishes and life becomes more 
            uniform. <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; The aesthetic perceptions experienced today, mark a general 
            perception transformation. It looks as if beauty is no longer seen 
            as an object of desire, but as a public object of scientific research 
            and styling. Fredrickson and Roberts (1997) term this particular perspective 
            &quot;self-objectification&quot;, and describe it as a form of self-consciousness 
            that is characterised by habitual and constant self-monitoring of 
            one's outward appearance to a prescribed ideal image. This has created 
            a completely new form of behavior which <em>Ariadne von Schirach</em> 
            calls &quot;Der Tanz um die Lust&quot;. Esthetic withdrawal, wrapped 
            up in desirability. Tangodance as a lifestyle-oriented social promotion. 
            To be seen at the place to be. The gaze and the exhibition are one 
            and the same, as bound in a looking mirror. Coco Chanel once said: 
            &quot;Elegance is refusal&quot;. As a result, nothing happens, they 
            do not move. An example is Samuel Beckett&#8217;s famous play &quot;Waiting 
            for Godot&quot;. Belonging to what is classified as <em>the theatre 
            of the absurd</em>. <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; Time changes the atmospheric and biological energy. Some aspects 
            of globalization are establishing uniformity. Uniformity or objectification 
            seems to be a historical process, the result of progress. Zeitgeists 
            refers to forces that have operated for centuries at all levels of 
            human activity. A time change is a phenomenon based on <em>destiny</em> 
            where something simultaneously happens everywhere at a certain time, 
            moving in the same direction. <br>

            &nbsp; <em>Spirit of the Times</em> (Zeitgeist): The &quot;timespirit&quot; 
            does not indicate a homogenous state of affairs in which everyone 
            goes along with the same idea, but rather expresses the fact that 
            in any given society, there is a certain &#8220;language&#8221;, culture 
            or range of concepts in which every dispute, every contradiction must 
            be fought out. This &#8220;terrain&#8221; which is expressed in the 
            Zeitgeist operates &#8220;behind the backs&#8221; of the participants, 
            changing their minds, using persuasion. There is an inbuilt drive 
            to act like the others in society, an urge to duplicate, it creates 
            an unconscious recurring pattern of behavioral codes. Imitation is 
            a part of prosperous relationship building, which is an important 
            concept to understand if one is to adapt and function effectively 
            in society. Sameness or similarity tend to be perceived as belonging 
            together, making it a safe unit, a close group. <em>Style, fashion, 
            vogue</em>. <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; Today's modern Western <strong>social imaginary</strong>, the 
            way a given people imagine their collective social life, is primarily 
            characterized an economy for exchanging goods and services to promote 
            mutual prosperity, the public sphere established by the community 
            is imagined as a metaphorical place for discussion among strangers 
            on issues of mutual concern. Unspoken strict rules called <em>etiquette</em> 
            model the manner of conducting yourself. Peculiarly the conversation 
            piece is important. Contemporary imagery values are not preoccupied 
            with <strong>sensory dimensions</strong>. Yet despite or perhaps because 
            of the fact that in today's social life there is a rejection-culture 
            of significant bodily contact, an increasing number of young and older 
            people turn to (couple) dancing. A contradiction? The primary focuses 
            of the <em>social dancing are s</em>ociability and socializing.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; Tango is a social dance originating in Buenos Aires, rioplatense. 
            History suggest that tango encounters were an intense competition 
            between men who sought to win the bodies of the women. It was also 
            a catalyst for racial and class tensions augmented by the invasion 
            of European immigrants. Between 1853 and 1930 Argentina got 6.000.000 
            immigrants. As 70% of the immigrants were masculine, a demographic 
            imbalance was produced between "Damas y Caballeros". European prostitutes 
            were imported, Franchuchas and there was also a women-traffic from 
            Warsaw, from the ghetto de Varsovie et les villages juifs de la Pologne, 
            but this mixture is the port-story of La Boca. The coloring chemistry 
            of all this makes the suburb, orillero, the expanding border of the 
            city of Buenos Aires. Yet the outcome, <strong><font size="3">tangodance</font></strong>, 
            tangoing, is more than a symptom, magnetic material lives inside the 
            unexpurgated core and is longing to come at the surface, yearning 
            for an occasion, a perfect habitat such as at the beginning of the 
            20th century. <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; As a reflection on developments of everyday life, one can say 
            that urbanisation has an immaterial side. Urbanisation organizes contemporary 
            our life. It has its own mechanisms for construction, bodies are included 
            or excluded. In a way, the environment works as non-verbal communication 
            and as the most important messages between people are nonverbal, the 
            environmental conditions are an important factor in modelling behavior. 
            Surroundings have a distinctive atmosphere, vibrations which can evoke 
            or suppress things. As in <em>Playtime</em>, the movie of <strong>Jacques 
            Tati</strong>, the landscape is continually changing under the influence 
            of many different forces. <br>

            <br>
            &nbsp; As in drama, there is tension in tango, made by the opposition 
            of characters in a dueling embrace, a reason why tango is called the 
            forbidden dance. Without drama, tension, especially humor, a moment 
            of alertness, awareness, the space to do something amusing, unsafe, 
            the movements have no real meaning.<br>

            <br>
            &nbsp; Tango's core can be infectious and as <strong>body and mind</strong> 
            are indissociable, dance can intensify this bound and transform a 
            person. <br>
            In this transformation, the act of <strong>repeating</strong> is essential. 
            <br>
            Only through repetition does the subject appear, repetition incorporates 
            both pleasure and pain, the elements of passion. <br>
            Acquiring more accurate movement control can change the self-perception, 
            which is always subjective, leading to a higher self-confidence, self-esteem 
            and sense of well-being. <br>
            Through the body one can even have the experience of finding one's 
            true identity, as if the body was locked-up and the self-image was't 
            one's own reflection, as if one was not living inside the body, being 
            unbound from it. <br>
            &nbsp; As tango is a couple-dance that can give sensations of true 
            contact, this close embrace makes it easier that the same act of changing 
            happens in relations. These changes are like a trance. A <strong>trance</strong> 
            is the natural resource state and all trances are not created equal, 
            everybody experiences it differently, apparently unaware of one's 
            own vacuum. <br>
            It is possible that there is also an influence through the content, 
            the meaning of the tango-movements. <br>
            &nbsp; A gesture has an emotional intention, expressing an idea and 
            like words, movements have impact. The <strong>environement</strong> 
            in which tango is born, rests in it, a dance has<strong> roots</strong>. 
            These roots meet the body through the art of dancing. The contact 
            with the power of this <strong>embodied culture</strong>, evoke a 
            bodily feeling from within and that relates to the world beyond the 
            limits of one&#8217;s skin, a true sensation like discovering something 
            lost. As if there is an embodied<strong> collective memory</strong> 
            that can be remembered when the body takes over. <br>

            &nbsp; There is <STRONG>nothing more &quot;tango&quot; than seamed 
            fishnets</STRONG>. Sexy seams lengthen the leg. In tangoshows, the 
            seduction of the Forties comes back in seamed pantyhose with naughty 
            details. The traditional show themes play on old stereotypes, featuring 
            male dancers dressed in faux 1940s tough-guy garb and women in their 
            <em>fetish fashion</em>, outfits like the symbolic fishnet stockings, 
            very highheels and skirts with long side slit sheer to the waist. 
            These outdated <em>clich&eacute;s are more complexe</em> than they 
            seem. These costumes alter an appearance, the clothed body refers 
            to conscious and<em> unconscious</em> uses of disguise. It is an act 
            of re-imaging an entity, masking the so-called original, masquerading 
            till a new authentic identity is acting. <br>

            &nbsp; Dance involves taking on a role, revealing a character and 
            playing a play, like enacting the <strong>power of the prostitute 
            metaphor </strong>which is in stark contrast to the ideal of marriage. 
            The prostitute metaphor is first applied in the Hebrew Testament. 
            The marriage and prostitute metaphors continue in the New Testament. 
            The prostitute was seen as having magical powers. She seduced men 
            and lured them with her wiles &#8211; through the clothing she wore, 
            through her physical and social charms, and through her cosmetics 
            and perfumes. The dance of sexual interplay between man and prostitute 
            was also marked by tolerance of violence toward the prostitute. The 
            sexuality of the prostitute embodies the evil nature of female sexuality, 
            and a woman's potential to hold a disturbing power over a man in the 
            sexual realm. The prostitute was viewed as a temptress, who lured 
            men through their carnal desires. <br>
            &nbsp; In Hebrew the meaning of the word<em> fornication</em> is &quot;broader&quot; 
            than <em>adultery</em>. To<em> fornicate</em> or to play the whore, 
            becomes virtually synonymous with engagement in <em>idolatry, the 
            worship of idols, images </em>that are not God. No metaphor, especially 
            as it symbolizes the practice of idolatry, is more powerful than the 
            woman as whore, in all of the captivating sexual imagery it symbolized. 
            But the dancing is in this not the crucial thing, it is the attractive 
            woman. If a man is performing the dance, it will not bewitch the audience 
            so intense, there will be no general arousal of the public mind and 
            the dancer will not get a bad reputation, he does not embodies the 
            fantasies of society as it is.<br>

            &nbsp; Looking at the<strong> origines </strong>of tango, you can 
            ask how it feels to be poor and alone in such a rivalrous environement. 
            Or: Why do people dance? Why generate a new way of dancing ? What 
            is the emotional content, drive behind the technique? Is there an 
            intent on committing something valid? Why develop tango, when there 
            are other couple dances ? What is the <strong>surplus pleasure</strong> 
            ? Is it a more sensual sense of being? Why is one overwhelmed by pleasure? 
            Can this way of dancing, this leading and following which is a non-verbal 
            conversation, can this bodylanguage fullfill fundamental biological 
            needs ? The <strong>need</strong> for a profound fysical, mutual understanding 
            must have been real for the solitary immigrants arriving in a highly 
            competitive environent, where one must be eager to surpass others 
            to survive. Maybe also a great craving for dominance, compensatory 
            striving behavior to appear strong. <br>

            &nbsp; So... looking at the fascinating panorama in which tango is 
            born, one can ask if the past is really folklore, out of date, finished. 
            Chronology is a nice way of putting things in perpective, it creates 
            an illusion of evolution, yet a<strong> phenomenon</strong> appears 
            through time in different shapes. Thus, all layers are always there 
            but not always obvious. History creates a more complete sculpture, 
            revealing less consoius influences in the art of moving. A living 
            thing has many dimensions, they become visible when the time is wright.

            &nbsp; The way of finding new points of view and looking for how and 
            where the transformations are already occurring, is related to the 
            NLP deep-modelling process. It is setting aside the conscious mind 
            that is basically a social construction, and exploring the archetypal 
            mind. <br>
            Locate your mind within your body and within the living field of relational 
            connections, and try to enter into that person's space and experiencing 
            their way of knowing. You can do it from an interior and exterior 
            space, both giving access to a whole other level of identity consciousness. 
            It is an expansive field that has no limit. By embodying consciousness 
            and situating it in a larger relational field, we can become more 
            guided. You can take hold of alienating, negative <strong>influences</strong> 
            and make your mark in a more conscious way. <br>

            &nbsp; In Argentina, not only those of the high classes rejected tango, 
            any family which claims to be respectable closed its doors to it, 
            those of the middle and working class as well. To dance tango was, 
            and for some still is to contaminate yourself with its origin as a 
            brothel dance, a <strong>scandal </strong> for the families. The African 
            rhythms who gave birth to the tango were suppressed and confined as 
            the dance form was &#8216;refined&#8217; by Western Europeans. The 
            flirtacious closeness of the first black tango dancers was replaced 
            with the more rigid form of the dance in the early twentieth century, 
            as the tension between succeeding waves of European immigrants, as 
            well as rural and urban environments, increased. None of the tensions 
            were resolved and the European immigrants, a new army of laborers, 
            had already arrived. No time for healing. More exiles, more distress, 
            and again, few women. <br>

            <BR>
            <br>
            &nbsp; The stiff torsos of the black dances became stiffer, the swaying 
            hips (&#8216;quebradas&#8217;) and the sharp interruptions of the 
            dancing marches (&#8216;cortes&#8217;) lost their joyful fluidity 
            and became grave, and so did the faces, concentrated in displaying 
            filigrees of footwork (&#8216;figuras&#8217;) for an escaped attentive 
            audience. Forced to compete with the immigrant for jobs, women, social 
            status in a system that seemed to favour only the foreigner, the urban 
            creole took out his frustration and bitterness against the immigrant 
            and the elite in a new &#8216;duello criollo&#8217;, the tango. In 
            this<strong> &#8216;duello&#8217;</strong>, the object was to show 
            up the immigrant or the upper class &#8216;s.<br>
            Nuestro Tango became deep and serious in the early twentieth century 
            and transformed itself into an intensely physical dance that evoked 
            the unspeakable wounds in the subconscious mind. Ernesto Santos Disc&eacute;polo 
            summed up the tango as<strong> &#8220;un pensamiento triste que se 
            puede bailar&#8221;</strong>, while Ram&oacute;n G&oacute;mez de la 
            Serna described the tango almost as an irritant that keeps old wounds 
            open, that tears them open until they bleed. <br>
            As a physical language, the unspeakable vital passion is inherent 
            in the dance movements, like the the collective soul of the &quot;identidad 
            prohibida&quot;, the African roots.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; Thus, tango grew from a fusion of the emotional, slow rhythm 
            of habanera with the strength of candombe and the choreography of 
            milonga. Milonga was in the 1880's a popular dance, and also the Can-Can, 
            a dance of African Caribbean origin was common then. The habanera 
            comes from the Flamenco guajira, which was transferred to Cuba, where 
            it became a dance in which the dancers intertwine with each other. 
            Changed in this way, it returned to Spain. Passing through the Canary 
            Island, it was named habanera. Musicians of those days, mostly Creole 
            guitarists and payadores (popular troubadours), began to adapt their 
            music to changes in population and the pulse of the city. From there 
            would evolve tango, which, from its beginnings, contributed its own 
            rhythm, melody and a different structure. <BR>
            <BR>
            The coloring chemistry of all this is the suburb, orillero, the expanding 
            border of the city of Buenos Aires. Between 1853 and 1930 Argentina 
            gets 6.000.000 immigrants. As 70% of the immigrants are masculine, 
            a demographic imbalance is produced. European prostitutes were imported, 
            Franchuchas and there was also a women-traffic from Warsaw, from the 
            ghetto de Varsovie et les villages juifs de la Pologne, but this mixture 
            is the port-story of La Boca.<BR>
            <BR>
            The black inhabitants, about 25 percent of Buenos Aires’ population 
            at the time, had their own dances. These Africans recently freed from 
            slavery, had achieved a more supportive community, forming mutual-aid 
            societies largely financed by street processions and gatherings, called 
            tangos. Between the happy quarters &quot;Monserrat&quot; must be remembered, 
            in the old days the negroes' quarter, barrio de negros candomberos, 
            with his Calle del Pecado, street of the Sin with a brothel next to 
            other. <BR>
            <br>
            These Africanos would move to the candombe rhythm, the intense beat 
            of tambourine percussion in which couples didn’t touch each other. 
            The music, drumming and dancing at these functions attracted onlookers, 
            the compadritos and foreign newcomers looking for amusement, mischief, 
            escape. They borrowed the uninhibited movements and insistent rhythms 
            to add to their own contemporary dances, the milonga, mazurka, and 
            waltz, adding a close upper-body embrace and simulating drums with 
            staccato footbeats on the dirt floors. <br>
            <br>
            The pulse of tango stood up in African-Argentine dance venues attended 
            by compadritos. This compadrito was a degeneration of the gaucho, 
            the compadre ideal. These Argentine gauchos were single men, drifted 
            toward the city, away from their beloved pampas and the way of life 
            that defined them. Some went to work in the slaughterhouses (frigor&iacute;ficos) 
            and others remained outsiders, displaced persons, chronologically 
            misplaced. The city version of the proud gaucho was called a compadre, 
            hard-working and hard-fighting, personifying masculine courage, ready 
            to defend his family, friends and ideals with the knife. Country-bred 
            concepts of personal honor and valor soon proved anachronistic within 
            the urban environment. <br>
            The shortage of meaningful work and feelings of isolation in the new 
            society caused deep disillusionment followed by a breakdown of traditional 
            values, creating the compadrito: a street-wise swaggerer, mostly native 
            born and poor young men, who liked to dress in slouch hats, loosely 
            tied neckerchiefs and high-heeled boots with knives tucked casually 
            into their belts, a punk looking for an easy buck, a good time, and 
            any excuse to fight. They took the tango back to the Corrales Viejos, 
            the slaughterhouse district of Buenos Aires, and introduced it in 
            various low-life establishments where dancing took place. It was here 
            that the African rhythms met the Argentine milonga music (a fast-walking 
            polka) and soon new steps were invented.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; Although high society looked down upon the activities in the 
            barrios, wealthy sons of the porte&ntilde;o oligarchy were not averse 
            to slumming. Eventually, everyone found out about the tango and, by 
            the beginning of the twentieth century, the tango as both a dance 
            and as an embryonic form of popular music had established a firm foothold 
            in the fast-expanding city of its birth. It soon spread to provincial 
            towns of Argentina and across the River Plate to Montevideo, the capital 
            of Uruguay, where it became as much a part of the urban culture as 
            in Buenos Aires. The worldwide spread of the tango came in the early 
            1900s, when rich ni&ntilde;o bien's of Argentine society families 
            made their way to Paris and introduced the tango into a society eager 
            for innovation and not entirely averse to the nature risqu&eacute; 
            of the dance or dancing with young, loaded Latin men.<br>
            <br>
            A very old way of dancing own to that compadrito of the orillero and 
            which shows the African mark in tango more clearly is <strong>Canyengue 
            (1890-1920)</strong>. Ca&ntilde;iegue dance is almost without figures, 
            freely from choreographic signal element sequences, but with fast 
            play of the feet, with playing, elastic legs. A dance in which rhythm 
            is everything.<BR>
            The rapid tango movements, cortes (the introduction of figures to 
            interrupt the forward walk of the dance) and quebradas (bending or 
            breaking the line of the spine backbone). Men held women close and 
            they danced head to head, perhaps because they needed to see what 
            their feet were doing, and the couple danced lifting their feet off 
            the ground, because of the dirt floor.<BR>
            <br>
            The street barrel-organs (organitos callejeros) spread and it was 
            very common to see dancing in the streets, often between men, the 
            few women would dance inside the house. There were musicians in the 
            theatres, in which musicals were performed, and there was also music 
            in the bars near the harbor and at the bordellos (piringundines), 
            where the huge male population looked for sex, entertainment and companionship. 
            <BR>
            For being places of permanent conflicts, a certain repression was 
            exercised on the casitas lupanares (burdeles, bordels, lupanars) and 
            gambling houses where also was danced. <BR>
            Some years later, with a more permissive government, there is a boom 
            of <STRONG>dance academies, academias de baile</STRONG> with reasonable 
            prices and with the best serviceability, comfort and decency. These 
            &quot;Casas de Baile&quot; were rented by people with sufficient money 
            to hold dances, the women, and the alcohol. So, dances are organized: 
            They begin at five o'clock in the afternoon and are not finishing 
            before three o'clock in the morning. Each man pays five pesos to an 
            Italian "Maestro de Ceremonias", the woman gets a payment of fifteen 
            pesos for one night (paid beforehand for the company) and a pair of 
            shoes for dancing the whole night. <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; Beside the real dance academies where professional dancers 
            gave their instructions, there were the other &quot;academies&quot;, 
            more or less high class enramadas (brothels), down to the humble quilombos 
            (whorehouses) of the suburbs. Some places were offering the double 
            service. And, also polkas, milongas, waltzes, any rhythm that was 
            encouraging the ambience was OK, there were not only tangos for touching 
            each other. One of Edgar Degas' most famous works is a suspicious 
            sculpture of a young ballet dancer, &quot;La Petite Danseuse de Quatorze 
            Ans&quot;, connecting ballet, bourgeoisie and prostitution at 14. 
            Be fair, the Viennese Waltz was the world's first popular dance to 
            use the actual "closed hold", what is now accepted as the standard 
            Ballroom hold. The Bohemian Polka was the second dance in Europe to 
            use this scandalous new close hold embrace, an "immoral" way of dancing 
            during the early 19th century. This form of dance was brought by emigrants 
            as they moved to Argentina. Around 1900 was also danced at the coffee 
            houses were there was a substantial consumption of cocaine, at the 
            time a Freudian Nouvelle Vogue.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; From 1880 on, a <strong>Paris Fever</strong> developed and 
            the Argentine society of Buenos Aires reflected a strong desire to 
            imitate whatever French Paris had to offer. Like in Paris, <strong>cabarets</strong>, 
            night clubs were opened and flourished, and gradually tango advanced 
            from the obscurity of the bordellos to the multicolor lights of city 
            night life. As always, most of the customers were men, alone or in 
            group, who used to go to dance with the girls who worked there, called 
            &quot;<strong>taxi-dancers</strong>&quot; (alternadoras, milongas 
            or coperas). When the venue was about to close, the orchestra played 
            &quot;La cumparsita&quot;, the last tango of the evening. Then the 
            pimps turned up to pick up their taxi dancers and to collect their 
            percentage. <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; The life of these taxi &quot;milonguitas&quot; (girls from 
            14 till their early 20's) and &quot;milongueras&quot; (women between 
            25 and 40) was hard. It was a life of shame, violence, alcoholism, 
            drugs and diseases like tbc. As the rates of syphillis and other sexually 
            transmitted diseases were alarming, a femme fatale became more dangerous 
            than an alluring and seductive &quot;playboy bunny&quot; whose charms 
            traped her lovers in bonds of irresistible desires. The threat of 
            these diseases give another connotation to <em>femmes fatales</em> 
            and tango as the forbidden dance. <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; A critical time of the tango history happened in the <strong>Night 
            clubs</strong>, Armenonville (1875) was the earliest. It was customary 
            for the evening's dance to start with a polka, and to conclude when 
            the number of reserved hours came to an end. The musicians averaged 
            5 pesos per evening, the same price as a visit to a prostitute in 
            La Boca or for buying a phonograph record (Albert Londres). This was 
            for the music-playing immigrants a source of income and a way of adapting 
            to society, and later... the big dream of the cabaret-stage: conquer 
            America, a Broadway show. In the early days, only a piano played, 
            but later groups included a violin or two, and a flute. Eventually, 
            bandoneons were added. In the year 1902 and in the successive ones, 
            the Theater Operates organizes dances with tangos and when the <STRONG>record 
            and movie industry</STRONG> appeared, there is a mass development 
            of all music and especially of the polished tango icon Carlos Gardel.

            &nbsp; In recent years, especially since Argentina's disastrous economic 
            crisis of january 2002, <strong>tango tourism</strong> has become 
            an important source of revenue for the city's economy and Argentinian 
            males can get an income as a taxi-dancer. Taxi dancers rent themselves 
            to foreign tangotourists for the social dance only, un giro extra&ntilde;o: 
            <br>
            &nbsp; <em>Como estaba &quot;deprimido empec&eacute; a ir a las milongas 
            para distraerme, iba a mirar, como un hobby&quot;. A ese hobby le 
            debe su emprendimiento, Tango TaxiDancers, un servicio de acompa&ntilde;antes 
            para que los extranjeros aprendan a sacarle viruta al piso. Yo estaba 
            casado y no iba de levante. Sacaba a bailar a las que siempre quedan 
            de lado. Los grandes maestros buscan bailarinas profesionales para 
            lucirse. Yo bailaba con las gordas, las de anteojos, las petisas, 
            las viejas&quot;. Las extranjeras tambi&eacute;n planchaban porque 
            los buenos bailarines son elitistas. Un d&iacute;a cabece&oacute; 
            a una americana y bailaron. &quot;Una amiga profesora me pidi&oacute; 
            que llevara a bailar a un grupo de alumnos brasileros&quot;. Otra 
            vez, la verg&uuml;enza. &quot;Dame lo que vos quieras&quot;, le dijo. 
            Al final cobr&oacute; y as&iacute; naci&oacute;, por fin, Tango Taxi 
            Dancers. La tarifa arranca en los US$ 15 por hora y puede llegar hasta 
            los US$ 100. El precio depende del nivel del bailar&iacute;n y de 
            la cantidad de horas que contrate. Hoy tiene una base de datos con 
            setenta bailarines y bailarinas a los que llama cuando los turistas 
            le piden acompa&ntilde;antes para moverse al ritmo del dos por cuatro. 
            Pero ojo, a no confundir los taxi dancers con otro tipo de taxis humanos. 
            &quot;Desde el principio dejamos claro que esto es s&oacute;lo para 
            bailar&quot;. El servicio se adapta a las necesidades de los clientes 
            pero &quot;lo m&aacute;s com&uacute;n es darles una clase de tango 
            y despu&eacute;s llevarlos a la milonga a practicar. Vamos a lugares 
            que no est&aacute;n contaminados por el turismo&quot;. Unas clientas 
            europeas &quot;se quedaron a vivir ac&aacute; y pusieron un hotel

            Comme le corps et l'esprit sont indissociable, la danse peut transformer 
            une personne. Dans cette transformation, l'acte de r&eacute;p&eacute;tition 
            est essentiel. La r&eacute;p&eacute;tition incorpore tant plaisir 
            que douleur, les &eacute;l&eacute;ments de passion, encore Lacan.

            <strong>Paroles de tangos </strong><br>
            &nbsp; La r&eacute;clusion ou la s&eacute;gr&eacute;gation des prostitu&eacute;es, 
            donc des femmes, sont des pratiques qui ont, en Argentine et particuli&egrave;rement 
            &agrave; Buenos Aires, de lointaines racines historiques. En 1624, 
            le conseil municipal de Buenos Aires a ordonn&eacute; que toutes les 
            femmes de<em> mauvaise fr&eacute;quentation</em> soient oblig&eacute;es 
            de vivre dans des habitations &eacute;loign&eacute;es des maisons 
            honn&ecirc;tes et principales. M&ecirc;me si cet ordre ne s&#8217;est 
            jamais concr&eacute;tis&eacute;, cette id&eacute;e de s&eacute;gr&eacute;guer 
            les prostitu&eacute;es dans des quartiers sp&eacute;ciaux revient 
            &agrave; diff&eacute;rentes &eacute;poques. L&#8217;ordonnance de 
            1875, qui inaugure l&#8217;&eacute;tape r&eacute;glementaire, &eacute;tablissait 
            que les bordels devaient s&#8217;&eacute;tablir loin des &Eacute;glises 
            et des rues tr&egrave;s fr&eacute;quent&eacute;es. On y indiquait 
            aussi qu&#8217;il &eacute;tait interdit de vendre des boissons alcooliques 
            et que les jeux de hasard n&#8217;&eacute;taient pas autoris&eacute;s. 
            On retrouve dans les registres de la Municipalit&eacute; de Buenos 
            Aires la demande de voisins d&#8217;un bordel exigeant, indign&eacute;s, 
            la fermeture de celui-ci en ce qu&#8217;il nuisait &agrave; la moralit&eacute; 
            du voisinage. Ils ne cherchaient pas &agrave; &eacute;liminer la prostitution, 
            se contentant de la rendre invisible. <br>

            de comparer les axes des d&eacute;bats au d&eacute;but et &agrave; 
            la fin du XXe si&egrave;cle afin d&#8217;&eacute;tablir certaines 
            similarit&eacute;s, diff&eacute;rences, r&eacute;p&eacute;titions

            Alors qu&#8217;un flux continu d&#8217;hommes et de femmes europ&eacute;ennes 
            &eacute;migrait en Am&eacute;rique, il est un fait historique que 
            des milliers de femmes, principalement en provenance de Pologne, de 
            Russie, de France, d&#8217;Italie, mais aussi &#8212; dans une moindre 
            mesure &#8212; d&#8217;autres pays europ&eacute;ens, furent recrut&eacute;es 
            pour les bordels de Buenos Aires et d&#8217;autres villes d&#8217;Argentine. 
            Pour r&eacute;pondre &agrave; la demande de tous types de pratiques 
            et pour tous types de clients, y compris de la haute bourgeoise. (N&#8217;oublions 
            pas qu&#8217;&agrave; cette &eacute;poque &agrave; Paris on qualifiait 
            une personne riche de &laquo; Riche comme un Argentin &raquo;. Paris 
            &eacute;tait l&#8217;un des lieux o&ugrave; les grands propri&eacute;taires 
            terriens argentins, qui passaient la moiti&eacute; de l&#8217;ann&eacute;e 
            en d&eacute;pensant leur argent.)<br>
            &nbsp; De nombreux textes &#8211; d&eacute;crets, lois nationales, 
            r&egrave;glements municipaux, t&eacute;moignages directs, proc&eacute;dures 
            judiciaires, actes parlementaires nationaux et municipaux, chroniques 
            de voyageurs, &eacute;tudes universitaires, <em>paroles de tangos</em> 
            et fictions litt&eacute;raires populaires, &#339;uvres d&#8217;art&#8211; 
            relatent les diff&eacute;rents aspects de <em>la vie des bordels</em> 
            &agrave; cette &eacute;poque (1875 -1935), o&ugrave; la prostitution 
            &eacute;tait l&eacute;galis&eacute;e et r&eacute;glement&eacute;e 
            en Argentine. Des textes r&eacute;cents font &eacute;galement r&eacute;f&eacute;rence 
            &agrave; cette p&eacute;riode co&iuml;ncidant avec la consolidation 
            d&#8217;une &eacute;conomie bas&eacute;e sur l&#8217;exportation de 
            produits agricoles et de p&ecirc;che et l&#8217;importation de produits 
            industrialis&eacute;s d&#8217;Europe. Cette situation &eacute;conomique 
            favorise l&#8217;arriv&eacute;e d&#8217;une immigration europ&eacute;enne 
            de paysans et d&#8217;artisans modestes, qui affronterait des conditions 
            de vie et de travail difficiles alors m&ecirc;me qu&#8217;ils esp&eacute;raient 
            surmonter la mis&egrave;re qu&#8217;ils fuyaient. Les deux auteurs, 
            Donna Guy et Albert Londres, estiment que la raison fondamentale qui 
            pousse les femmes &agrave; &laquo; accepter &raquo; ou &agrave; &laquo; 
            choisir &raquo; de se prostituer est la pauvret&eacute; ; un argument 
            qu&#8217;on retrouve de nos jours dans d&#8217;autres &eacute;tudes. 
            Il s&#8217;agit d&#8217;une explication de l&#8217;existence de la 
            prostitution, souvent quasi exclusive, et qui continue &agrave; &ecirc;tre 
            invoqu&eacute;e de nos jours. Albert Londres consid&egrave;re &agrave; 
            tout le moins que la pauvret&eacute;, si elle est la cause r&eacute;elle 
            de la prostitution, est en concurrence avec la demande. Quand Londres 
            d&eacute;clare que le prox&eacute;n&egrave;te &laquo; fabrique son 
            produit &raquo;, il explique le processus en citant les prox&eacute;n&egrave;tes 
            qu&#8217;il avait contact&eacute;s en personne : &quot;<em>On la prend, 
            on la lave, on la r&eacute;cure. On l&acute;habille d&eacute;cemment. 
            On lui donne le go&ucirc;t du linge propre. On l&acute;arrache de 
            ses basses fr&eacute;quentations. Moi j&#8217;ai pay&eacute; un professeur 
            &agrave; la mienne. Elle ne savait ni lire, ni &eacute;crire. Son 
            p&egrave;re et sa m&egrave;re ne l&#8217;avaient pas fait. On lui 
            apprend l&#8217;&eacute;conomie et le devoir envers la famille Sans 
            nous vanter, nous pouvons affirmer que quatre-vingt-dix pour cent 
            de ces femmes n&acute;avaient jamais soutenu leurs parents. Depuis 
            qu&#8217;elles ont un homme, elles envoient r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement 
            &agrave; leur vieille grande m&egrave;re, au p&egrave;re malade, aux 
            petites s&#339;urs. Plut&ocirc;t c&acute;est nous qui envoyons pour 
            elles. Voulez-vous voir les talons des mandats?</em>&quot;<br>
            &nbsp; La pauvret&eacute; ne semble pas &ecirc;tre la seule cause 
            de d&eacute;laissement. Dans la citation de Donna Guy, on parle de 
            marginalisation par la famille ou pour cause de pers&eacute;cutions 
            religieuses et politiques, auxquelles on pourrait ajouter les guerres. 
            Et si c&#8217;&eacute;tait le d&eacute;laissement social des femmes 
            qui constituait la circonstance facilitant la t&acirc;che des recruteurs&#8230; 
            Pourrait-on alors parler d&#8217;une v&eacute;ritable libert&eacute; 
            ? Les raisonnements de Londres et de Donna Guy donnent lieu &agrave; 
            des conclusions pr&eacute;tendant que la pauvret&eacute; extr&ecirc;me, 
            le d&eacute;sespoir ou l&#8217;ali&eacute;nation ne seraient pas des 
            situations qui inhibent la capacit&eacute; de choisir librement, m&ecirc;me 
            si les femmes se trouvent accul&eacute;es. Il suffit que l&#8217;on 
            ne force personne &agrave; la menace d&#8217;un couteau ou de violences 
            physiques, c&#8217;est-&agrave;-dire sans coercition physique ostentatoire 
            pour pouvoir soutenir cet argument.<br>
            &nbsp; C&#8217;est ainsi que selon Donna Guy, le fait d&#8217;entrer 
            dans un bordel &#8211; ou toute autre forme de prostitution &#8211; 
            ne constitue pas un geste d&eacute;sesp&eacute;r&eacute;, ni m&ecirc;me 
            le r&eacute;sultat d&#8217;une tromperie, d&#8217;une s&eacute;duction, 
            encore moins d&#8217;un rapt ou d&#8217;un viol, mais au contraire 
            une action courageuse pour assurer sa survie. Elle soutient que les 
            femmes qui se prostituent ne sont ni aussi passives, ni aussi victimes 
            qu&#8217;on ne le pr&eacute;tend. Elle revendique que les femmes ne 
            soient pas victimes en tant que femmes, mais au contraire dot&eacute;es 
            d&#8217;une grande capacit&eacute; de r&eacute;sistance, qui &eacute;agirait 
            fermement et positivement aux conditions sociales et &eacute;conomiques 
            d&eacute;favorables en acceptant volontairement la prostitution en 
            guise de <em>meilleure &eacute;chappatoire</em>. Mais reposons la 
            question autrement. La personne qui a choisi de se soumettre, ou de 
            continuer &agrave; se soumettre, dans un contexte social intimidant 
            &#8212; alors que sa libert&eacute; consiste en n&#8217;est pas pouvoir 
            choisir face a la manque d&#8217;options &#8211; est-elle libre?<br>
            &nbsp; Aujourd&#8217;hui comme hier, personne n&#8217;h&eacute;sitera 
            &agrave; mettre la faute sur le dos de la pauvret&eacute; et personne 
            ne se demandera pourquoi il s&#8217;agit de Dominicaines, de Paraguayennes 
            ou de Br&eacute;siliennes. Avant, personne ne se demandait d&#8217;ailleurs 
            non plus pourquoi il s&#8217;agissait en majorit&eacute; de Fran&ccedil;aises, 
            d&#8217;Italiennes et de Juives de Pologne. Peut-&ecirc;tre ces pays 
            &eacute;taient-ils les seuls &agrave; souffrir de la pauvret&eacute; 
            en Europe ? Peut-&ecirc;tre &eacute;taient-ils les plus pauvres ? 
            Seules les femmes de ces pays-l&agrave; avaient d&eacute;cid&eacute; 
            de s&#8217;&eacute;chapper de la mis&egrave;re en acceptant de se 
            prostituer ? Ne faudrait-il pas convenir que la pauvret&eacute; ne 
            constitue qu&#8217;un facteur parmi d&#8217;autres, qui facilite le 
            recrutement et la traite sans constituer le facteur d&eacute;cisif 
            ? Dans ce cas, ne pas remettre en question la r&eacute;alit&eacute; 
            des pratiques, la culture qui les rend possibles, qui en fait une 
            cons&eacute;quence logique et in&eacute;vitable ; ne pas remettre 
            en question le r&ocirc;le de la demande, c&#8217;est-&agrave;dire 
            une sexualit&eacute; li&eacute;e au pouvoir, avec ou sans argent, 
            ce ne serait pas fermer les yeux sur le vrai probl&egrave;me ? Finalement, 
            il existe aujourd&#8217;hui comme hier un double discours. <br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; Au plus simple, le paradoxe na&icirc;t de la superposition 
            ou de l&#8217;entrelacement d'id&eacute;es et de propositions r&eacute;put&eacute;es 
            incompatibles ou contradictoires, dans l&#8217;unit&eacute; de temps 
            et de lieu, comme la poule qui est &agrave; la fois fin et commencement 
            dans la circularit&eacute; de l&#8217;&#339;uf conduisant &agrave; 
            la poule qui est aussi exact que la poule &agrave; l&#8217;&#339;uf, 
            comme l&#8217;identit&eacute; des diff&eacute;rents et l&#8217;unit&eacute; 
            des distincts. Dans le dilemme, il y a n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de 
            choisir alors que le paradoxe est une obligation de choisir. <br>

            &nbsp; Este proyecto se basa en las distintas oleadas inmigratorias 
            que llegaron a la Argentina desde 1880 hasta 1914. Y de las consecuencias 
            de las mismas dejaron en nuestro pa&iacute;s. Trata de explicar y 
            dar a conocer las tendencias e ideales pol&iacute;ticos que ten&iacute;an 
            los inmigrantes, sus costumbres, desde donde proven&iacute;an, cu&aacute;les 
            eran sus objetivos, por qu&eacute; eligieron nuestro pa&iacute;s y 
            c&oacute;mo repercuti&oacute; en la sociedad de ese entonces. Este 
            trabajo tiene como objetivo que todos puedan saber y entender quienes 
            fueron los que sentaron las bases de la organizaci&oacute;n de la 
            sociedad actual; y que mediante Internet se pueda acceder a este tipo 
            de informaci&oacute;n, que nos permite comprender el pasado y poder 
            mejorar el presente.<br>
            &nbsp; Nada hay tan &iacute;ntimo y p&uacute;blico a la vez&#8230; 
            como bailar. El tango, como toda manifestaci&oacute;n popular, nace 
            espont&aacute;neamente en Argentina, resultado de la necesidad de 
            expresi&oacute;n del pueblo, a fines de la d&eacute;cada de 1870. 
            Es el lenguaje del cuerpo que permite al alma expresar sus sentimientos, 
            pasi&oacute;n y fuerza que crea y se recrea en la belleza y la din&aacute;mica 
            del movimiento. Fuertes emociones, en particular, que llevan a los 
            &oacute;rganos a un punto de exaltaci&oacute;n que espont&aacute;neamente 
            se manifiesta a si mismo a trav&eacute;s de movimientos m&aacute;s 
            o menos r&iacute;tmicos que constituyen lo que se podr&iacute;a considerar 
            como danzas naturales. Las expresiones espontaneas, como tambien el 
            arte de bailar, pueden ser descritos como una expresi&oacute;n de 
            los sentimientos por medio de los movimientos del cuerpo mas o menos 
            controlados por el propio sentido r&iacute;tmico. El baile, como arte 
            era utilizado para varios prop&oacute;sitos. El arte existe en todos 
            lados de la ciudad y en formas infinitas. <br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; La sensualidad del tango, la conexi&oacute;n corporal, 
            puede ser muy pesada, apasionada, y seria. En el tango no exist&iacute;a 
            la regularidad de las viejas danzas como el vals o la polca y por 
            eso fue necesario creer una t&eacute;cnica en la cual la pareja pod&iacute;a 
            realizar una figura en el momento sin anticipaci&oacute;n. El lugar 
            donde se desarroll&oacute; m&aacute;s el tango al principio del sigo 
            XX fue dentro de las burdeles donde los hombres bailaban en una forma 
            mucho m&aacute;s sensual que permitir&iacute;an las estrictas reglas 
            sociales de la sociedad respetuosa. La mujer ten&iacute;a que seguir 
            siempre el hombre paso por paso movi&eacute;ndose con sus caprichos 
            y as&iacute; se fue formando la estructura de la danza que se sigue 
            bailando hoy en d&iacute;a. En un baile tan &iacute;ntimo, no se puede 
            bailar con cualquier hombre. As&iacute; que la mirada tiene un papel 
            muy importante en la cultura del tango. La mirada en el baile es intima 
            pero liviana. La mirada tambi&eacute;n existe en relaci&oacute;n al 
            publico, que est&aacute; siempre presente en los milongas. El tango 
            es como un espejo, en su capacidad de reflejar todo el desarrollo 
            de una identidad social y relaciones sociales. <br>
            &nbsp; <em>Las transformaciones en el esp&iacute;ritu del tango</em><br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; La pregunta que se impone, es: <em>&iquest; por qu&eacute; 
            el tango, m&uacute;sica del instinto sexual y de la algarab&iacute;a 
            prostibularia se convierte en tan pocos a&ntilde;os en un discurso 
            que afirma valores morales tan opuestos a los que le dieron origen? 
            &iquest;Por qu&eacute; el placer se transmuta en condena y el regocijo 
            en melancol&iacute;a ? </em> <br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; Entre 1900 y 1910 ese incipiente tango que se expresaba 
            en prost&iacute;bulos y arrabales de las afueras de la ciudad, empez&oacute; 
            lentamente a ganar terreno en los cabarets y peque&ntilde;os teatros 
            de Buenos Aires. De sus origines el tango fue una expresi&oacute;n 
            cultural degenerado muy particular a la situaci&oacute;n social Argentina, 
            pero cuando el tango fue aprobado al exterior se convirti&oacute; 
            de repente en una imagen de la identidad nacional. Igualmente, se 
            concretan ciertos s&iacute;mbolos sociales que pasar&aacute;n a formar 
            parte del folklore ciudadano. Para los &eacute;lites Argentinos el 
            tango todav&iacute;a pertenec&iacute;a a otro sector de la sociedad, 
            y implicaba una identidad ajena de los inmigrantes, los guapos, las 
            prostitutas y todo un mundo nocturnal y peligroso de la calle. La 
            m&uacute;sica es otra forma de arte que es muy importante en la cultura 
            argentina. Muchos argentinos hablan de ella con tanta pasi&oacute;n 
            y orgullo. La historia del tango entra as&iacute; en un contexto m&aacute;s 
            amplio de historia de gente exiliada y ileg&iacute;tima en b&uacute;squeda 
            de una identidad propia, reconocimiento y dignidad. <br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; El tango, apadrinado por los grupos sociales que el 
            centro no admit&iacute;a: inmigrantes, veteranos del ej&eacute;rcito, 
            ex-esclavos, todos proletarios en busca de una nueva vida que superara 
            el perfil miserable y prom&iacute;scuo de su marginaci&oacute;n. El 
            Lunfardo, una lengua que muchos asimilan a gente de mala vida, empleada 
            para que resultara incomprensible a las autoridades. En ese &quot;idioma&quot; 
            popular ya por entonces caracter&iacute;stico de los bajos fondos, 
            predominan los t&eacute;rminos de diversos dialectos italianos, con 
            algo de caf&eacute; gitano espa&ntilde;ol y el argot franc&eacute;s. 
            El tango lo elegir&aacute; posteriormente como su lengua predilecta, 
            ya ampliamente divulgada por el teatro y el intercambio personal que 
            se hac&iacute;a en los numerosos sitios bailables, y otros lugares 
            no muy santos, entre &quot;ni&ntilde;os bien&quot; del centro y &quot;compadritos&quot; 
            orilleros. As&iacute;, el tango pasa a los caf&eacute;s y bares del 
            centro, donde el contacto entre las diferentes clases sociales resulta 
            ya cosa normal y corriente. Es en los salones donde comienza una nueva 
            etapa para la m&uacute;sica ciudadana, sea como m&uacute;sica como 
            para danza. Cuando el tango &quot;se hace decente&quot;, sin cortes 
            ni quebradas, para alegrar fiestas de familia, viviendo un notable 
            auge que arranca a principios de la d&eacute;cada del '30 y eclosiona 
            con una popularidad sin igual entre 1940 y 1960. Cuando se extiende 
            a toda la ciudad y se convierte en la m&uacute;sica de Buenos Aires, 
            cuando proliferan compositores y poetas, es el mismo tango el que 
            dice de s&iacute; mismo ser un veneno que fascina, capaz de llevar 
            a las almas m&aacute;s nobles por el camino del mal. Micromercadot&eacute;cnia: 
            Hoy, merced a la llegada de oleadas de turistas extranjeros que hacen 
            florecer la econom&iacute;a e incentivan la inversi&oacute;n en locales 
            de entretenimientos y academias de baile, el tango est&aacute; viviendo 
            un renacer que algunos a&ntilde;os atr&aacute;s nadie hubiera imaginado. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>In italiano: </strong><br>
            Come il corpo e mente &egrave; indissociabile, il ballo pu&ograve; 
            trasformare una persona. In questa trasformazione, l'atto di ripetere 
            &egrave; essenziale. La ripetizione comprende sia il piacere che il 
            dolore, gli elementi di passione. <br>
            <br>
            L'acquisizione del controllo pi&ugrave; esatto del movimento pu&ograve; 
            cambiare la auto-percezione, conducente ad un'pi&ugrave; alti sicurezza 
            di s&egrave;, self-esteem e senso di benessere. Attraverso il corpo 
            uno pu&ograve; persino avere l'esperienza in scoprire che l'identit&agrave; 
            allineare di one's, come se una non stesse vivendo all'interno del 
            corpo, &egrave; non legato da esso. Poich&egrave; il tango &egrave; 
            un ballo delle coppie che pu&ograve; dare le sensazioni del contatto 
            allineare, questo abbraccia le marche esso pi&ugrave; facile che lo 
            stesso atto di cambiare si presenta nei rapporti. <br>
            Questi cambiamenti sono come un trance. Un trance &egrave; la condizione 
            naturale e tutti i trances non sono uguale generato, ognuno lo avverte 
            diversamente, apparentemente ignaro di one's possiedono il vuoto. 
            Ci &egrave; inoltre influenza con l'effetto dei movimenti. Un gesture 
            ha un'intenzione impressionabile, esprimente un'idea e come le parole, 
            i movimenti hanno effetto. Un ballo ha radici. Queste radici vengono 
            a contatto del corpo con l'arte di ballare. Il contatto con la forza 
            di questa coltura, evoca una sensibilit&agrave; corporea che si riferisce 
            al mondo oltre i limiti della sua pelle, una sensazione allineare 
            come la scoperta della qualcosa persa. Come se ci sia una memoria 
            collettiva nel corpo. <br>
            Questo senso di individuazione dei punti nuovi della vista e di ricerca 
            come e dove le trasformazioni gi&agrave; stanno accadendo, sta mettendo 
            la mente da parte cosciente e sta esplorando la mente archetypal. 
            Individui la vostra mente all'interno del vostro corpo ed all'interno 
            dei collegamenti relazionali viventi e della prova per entrare in 
            quello nello spazio di person's e nell'avvertire il loro senso di 
            sapere. Potete farli da uno spazio interno ed esterno, entrambi che 
            danno ad accesso ad un tutto l'altro livello della coscienza di identit&agrave;. 
            Potete prendere la stretta di alienazione, di influenze della negazione 
            e fare il vostro ballo in un senso pi&ugrave; cosciente. <br>
            <em>Il doppio legame </em>indica una situazione in cui, tra due individui 
            uniti da una relazione emotivamente rilevante, la comunicazione dell'uno 
            verso l'altro presenta una incongruenza tra il livello del discorso 
            esplicito (quel che vien detto) e un ulteriore livello metacomunicativo 
            (come possono essere i gesti, gli atteggiamenti, il tono di voce), 
            e la situazione sia tale per cui il ricevente il messaggio non abbia 
            la possibilit&agrave; di decidere quale dei due livelli, che si contraddicono, 
            accettare come valido, e nemmeno di far notare a livello esplicito 
            l'incogruenza.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Em portugu&ecirc;s: </strong><br>
            Como o corpo e a mente s&atilde;o indissociable, a dan&ccedil;a pode 
            transformar uma pessoa. Nesta transforma&ccedil;&atilde;o, a a&ccedil;&atilde;o 
            da repeti&ccedil;&atilde;o &eacute; essencial. A repeti&ccedil;&atilde;o 
            incorpora tanto prazer como a dor, os elementos da paix&atilde;o. 
            <br>
            <br>
            A aquisi&ccedil;&atilde;o controle de movimento mais exato pode modificar 
            a auto-percep&ccedil;&atilde;o, conduzindo a uma autoconfian&ccedil;a 
            mais alta, auto-estima e sentido do bem-estar. Pelo corpo cada um 
            pode at&eacute; ter a experi&ecirc;ncia de encontrar a identidade 
            verdadeira de algu&eacute;m, como se cada um n&atilde;o vivesse dentro 
            do corpo, sendo desatado dele. Como o tango &eacute; uma dan&ccedil;a 
            de par que pode dar sensa&ccedil;&otilde;es do contato verdadeiro, 
            este abra&ccedil;o f&aacute;-lo mais f&aacute;cil que a mesma a&ccedil;&atilde;o 
            da modifica&ccedil;&atilde;o ocorre em rela&ccedil;&otilde;es. Essas 
            modifica&ccedil;&otilde;es parecem-se com uma inconsci&ecirc;ncia. 
            Uma inconsci&ecirc;ncia &eacute; o estado natural e toda a inconsci&ecirc;ncia 
            n&atilde;o &eacute; criada equivalente, todo o mundo experimenta-o 
            diferentemente, ao que parece inconsciente do pr&oacute;prio v&aacute;cuo 
            de algu&eacute;m. H&aacute; tamb&eacute;m a influ&ecirc;ncia pelo 
            impacto dos movimentos. Um gesto tem uma inten&ccedil;&atilde;o emocional, 
            exprimindo uma id&eacute;ia e como palavras, os movimentos t&ecirc;m 
            o impacto. Uma dan&ccedil;a tem ra&iacute;zes. Essas ra&iacute;zes 
            encontram o corpo pela arte da dan&ccedil;a. O contato com a for&ccedil;a 
            desta cultura, evoque corp&oacute;reo sensa&ccedil;&atilde;o que se 
            relaciona ao mundo al&eacute;m dos limites da pele de algu&eacute;m, 
            uma sensa&ccedil;&atilde;o verdadeira como descobrimento de algo perdido. 
            Como se haja uma mem&oacute;ria coletiva no corpo. <br>
            Este modo de encontrar os novos pontos da vis&atilde;o e procurar 
            como e onde as transforma&ccedil;&otilde;es j&aacute; est&atilde;o 
            ocorrendo, est&aacute; deixando de lado a mente consciente e explorando 
            a mente arquet&iacute;pica. Localize a sua mente dentro do seu corpo 
            e dentro de conex&otilde;es relacionais vivas, e tente estabelecer 
            o espa&ccedil;o daquela pessoa e o experimento do seu modo de saber. 
            Voc&ecirc; pode faz&ecirc;-lo de um espa&ccedil;o interior e exterior, 
            ambo o acesso que d&aacute; a um todo outro n&iacute;vel da consci&ecirc;ncia 
            de identidade. Voc&ecirc; pode pegar influ&ecirc;ncias alienam, negativas

            <strong>Auf deutsch: </strong> <br>
            Wie K&ouml;rper und Meinung indissociable sind, kann Tanz eine Person 
            umgestalten. In dieser Transformation ist die Tat des Wiederholens 
            wesentlich. Wiederholung vereinigt sowohl Vergn&uuml;gen als auch 
            Schmerz, die Elemente der Leidenschaft. <br>
            Das Erwerben genauere Bewegungskontrolle kann die Selbstwahrnehmung 
            &auml;ndern, zu einem h&ouml;heren Selbstbewusstsein, Selbstachtung 
            und Sinn des Wohlbehagens f&uuml;hrend. Durch den K&ouml;rper kann 
            man sogar die Erfahrung haben, jemandes wahre Identit&auml;t zu finden, 
            als ob man innerhalb des K&ouml;rpers nicht lebte, davon losgebunden. 
            Wie Tango ein Paar-Tanz ist, der Sensationen des wahren Kontakts geben 
            kann, macht diese Umarmung es leichter, dass dieselbe Tat des &Auml;nderns 
            in Beziehungen vorkommen. Diese &Auml;nderungen sind einer Trance 
            &auml;hnlich. Eine Trance ist der nat&uuml;rliche Zustand, und alle 
            Trancen werden gleich nicht geschaffen, jeder erf&auml;hrt es verschieden, 
            anscheinend unbewusst jemandes eigenen Vakuums. Es gibt auch Einfluss 
            durch den Einfluss der Bewegungen. Eine Geste hat eine emotionale 
            Absicht, eine Idee und wie W&ouml;rter ausdr&uuml;ckend, Bewegungen 
            haben Einfluss. Ein Tanz hat Wurzeln. Diese Wurzeln treffen den K&ouml;rper 
            durch die Kunst des Tanzens. Der Kontakt mit der Kraft dieser Kultur, 
            rufen Sie ein k&ouml;rperliches Gef&uuml;hl herbei, das sich auf die 
            Welt au&szlig;er den Grenzen von jemandes Haut, eine wahre Sensation 
            wie das Entdecken von etwas Verlorenem bezieht. Als ob es ein gesammeltes 
            Ged&auml;chtnis im K&ouml;rper gibt. <br>
            <br>
            Diese Weise, neue Gesichtspunkte zu finden und zu suchen, wie und 
            wo die Transformationen bereits vorkommen, legt die bewusste Meinung 
            beisete und erforscht die archetypische Meinung. Legen Sie Ihre Meinung 
            innerhalb Ihres K&ouml;rpers und innerhalb von lebenden Verwandtschaftsverbindungen, 
            und versuchen Sie, in Raum dieser Person und das Erfahren ihrer Weise 
            einzutreten, zu wissen. Sie k&ouml;nnen es von einem Innen- und Au&szlig;enraum, 
            beider Geben-Zugang zu einem Ganzen anderes Niveau des Identit&auml;tsbewusstseins 
            tun. Sie k&ouml;nnen das Ver&auml;u&szlig;ern, negative Einfl&uuml;sse 
            ergreifen und Ihren Tanz auf eine bewusstere Weise machen. <br>

            <strong>Epiloog</strong> <br>
            <br>
            Iedereen heeft wel een beeld van tango,<br>
            vaak een clich&eacute; of oerbeeld. <br>
            Dit archetype zit in het collectieve onbewuste, de dans tussen anima 
            en animus.<br>
            Dit beeld kan veranderen door persoonlijke ervaringen, <br>
            de oorspronkelijke voorstelling echter komt voortdurend terug. <br>
            Het bevat elementen die het onderbewuste aanspreken, <br>
            details die tot de verbeelding spreken. <br>
            Details die verdwijnen in de grote lijnen van de geschiedenis,<br>
            zoals rituelen die doorheen de tijd geen belichaming meer krijgen.<br>
            <br>
            De omarming is in de geschiedenis zo'n schijnbaar weinig belangrijk 
            detail, <br>
            toch is het dansen van tango zo begonnen, <br>
            toen twee omarmende lichamen al dansend figuren probeerden te maken, 
            wachtend bij 't bordeel zeggen ze.<br>
            <br>
            Prostitutie wordt een bloeiende industrie in de nieuwe wereld. <br>
            <br>
            Het bordeel is meer dan een huis van plezier. <br>
            Het Engelse woord &quot;brothel&quot; komt van het oud Engels &quot;brothen&quot;, 
            geru&iuml;neerd, en &quot;br&eacute;othan&quot;, zich ru&iuml;neren, 
            en &quot;bropel&quot;, een waardeloos verlaten iemand. <br>
            Het woord legt nadruk op ondergang, onderwereld, <br>
            de donkere drift thanatos. <br>
            Eros is de dans,<br>
            misschien was er in de smeltkroes van culturen, <br>
            de hoop van de Amerikaanse droom nodig om de dans te doen bloeien.<br>
            <br>
            Rond 1900 is Argentini&euml; het te verzilveren land, <br>
            het verwerkelijkt de droom van &quot;hacer America&quot;. <br>
            <br>
            Lady Liberty: <em>Geef mij uw arme samengepakte, naar vrijheid hunkerende 
            massa&#8217;s. Het erbarmelijke afval van uw volle kusten, door de 
            storm naar mij geslingerd. Ik hef mijn lamp omhoog naast de gouden 
            deur.</em><br>
            <br>
            Maar de oorsprong waarin de aantrekkingskracht van tango verscholen 
            zit, <br>
            heeft voor elkeen een ander verhaal, <br>
            gelijk het leven is.<br>
            <br>
            Is tango macho of het Ewig-Weibliche ? <br>
            <br>
            Het contrast tussen de rechtlijnige stappen van de man en de draaibewegingen 
            van de vrouw,<br>
            geven visueel een binaire oppositie zoals yin/yang. <br>
            De vrouw is vaak in het rood en volgt, de man is in het zwart en leidt.<br>
            Zoals in schaken is leiden niet gelijk aan winnen, de spanning van 
            het spel is samenspel.<br>
            Zodra de betrokkenheid daalt is er een spontane deconstructie van 
            de hierarchie.<br>
            De man-vrouw verhouding is voortdurend instabiel. <br>
            <br>
            Gender oppositie is "La revancha del tango".<br>
            <br>
            Tango is erotische suspence. <br>
            Wat de verbeelding aanspreekt is het contrapunt in de dans,<br>
            de vrouw treedt op de voorgrond in het samenspel.<br>
            Het cliché is de sandwich-mordida, de vrouw stapt over de voet van 
            de man, <br>
            waarna ze soms een gancho maakt,<br>
            de haak van de happy hooker.<br>
            <br>
            Een ander verhaal. <br>
            De mannen bij de quilombos omarmen elkaar niet,<br>
            hun dans is als een messengevecht. Dit om hun viriliteit te demonstreren,<br>
            de prostituée is een begeerde bron van inkomsten, opwinding en seksueel 
            verlangen.<br>
            De aha: La Française ...<br>
            femme expérimentée et mystérieuse devant laquelle même les hommes 
            les plus riches et les plus experts devenaient des provinciaux.<br>
            <br>
            En achter de scène: vrouwenhandel, trafic de femmes:<br>
            Françaises, Espagnoles, Italiennes, Portugaises, Polonaises et Russes 
            ...<br>
            Globalisering van de erotische verbeelding.<br>
            Le chemin de Buenos Aires: Marseille, Bilbao, Montevideo, Buenos Aires... 
            1927, <br>
            Esclavas Blancas, Juifs indésirables.<br>
            Albert Londres, la mafia Française de traite des blanches...<br>
            <br>
            De muziekanten trekken ondertussen van het ene bordeel naar het andere, 
            <br>
            stimuleren het vertier met tangos over "Francesitas",<br>
            ces petites fleurs de Paris. <br>
            Deze economische onderbouw wordt met het cabaret meer cultureel acceptabel. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Le Chat Noir, Paris Monmartre 1881: het begin van de cabaret cultuur. 
            <br>
            Folies Bergère, het atelier van de dromen, music-hall. <br>
            Competitie om de mooiste benen.<br>
            Moderne vrouwen verdringen de klassieke dans.<br>
            Les Isadorables.<br>
            <br>
            Ook voor de filmindustrie is de vrouw de nieuwe toekomst.<br>
            Les années folles, er is nood aan een exotische lover. <br>
            Met de déstabilisatie van de seksuele relaties is de schaamte voorbij. 
            <br>
            Rudolph Valentino: Je sers aux femmes de canevas pour broder leurs 
            rêves.<br>
            De ridder op zijn paard... een gaucho,<br>
            si ma gueule vous plait.<br>
            <br>
            Shifting Identities... <br>
            The Stuff That Dreams Are Made Of.<br>
            <br>
            Verscheurdheid... tango<br>
            Sans toi, je suis seul contre mon coeur déchiré.<br>
            <br>
            Maar op zich heeft tango niets te maken<br>
            met wat de mensen er van maken,<br>
            de toekomst duurt lang.<br>
            &iexcl;Yira!... &iexcl;Yira!...<br>
