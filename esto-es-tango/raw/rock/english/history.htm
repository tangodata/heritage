        It is hard to believe, but there was once a time when there was no rock 
        music. Most historians trace the beginning rock back to the year 1954, 
        when a new type of music, then called Rock and Roll, appeared and revolutionized 
        musical tastes, at least among young people, and pretty much changed the 
        world. </p>
      <p>This new music, of course did not develop in a vacuum, but resulted from 
        the convergence of two musical styles, Rhythm and Blues and Country, as 
        well as a series of technological developments that created a new market 
        for music.</p>
      <p>Like Jazz, Rhythm and Blues developed from the music called the Blues. 
        The Blues, to review what you have already learned in the Jazz unit, &quot;grew 
        out of African spirituals and work songs sung by African-Americans in 
        the South. Many of these people had been brought to the United States 
        as slaves, and before the Civil war they labored in difficult situations 
        on the Southern plantations. 'Call and response' was often used as a means 
        of communication by the workers in the fields, who fooled the plantation 
        owners into thinking that their music was the 'happy' music of hard working 
        slaves.&quot;</p>
      <p> Rhythm and Blues developed from the Blues, and Rock and Roll developed 
        from Rhythm and Blues (R&amp;B). Little Richard, one of the great innovators 
        in 1950's rock music, has often said that &quot;Rhythm and Blues had a 
        baby and somebody named it rock and roll.&quot; He, of course is absolutely 
        right, and a number of important R&amp;B artists were part of the beginning 
        of Rock and Roll. Among them were Muddy Waters, Willie Mae Thornton, Joe 
        Turner and Ray Charles.</p>

      <p>While music was developing, technology was also changing. In the late 
        1940's and early 1950's, phonograph records were large and heavy and easily 
        damaged. These records played at 78 rpm's (78 revolutions per minute) 
        and were played on rather awkward record players that were usually part 
        of a large piece of furniture (console), which often was located in the 
        living room. Stereo had not yet been invented. In many homes, the entire 
        family would sit around the living room listening to bands like Glen Miller, 
        Tommy Dorsey and Benny Goodman, and soloists like Frank Sinatra, Patti 
        Paige, Doris Day, and Eddie Fisher. Record companies marketed music to 
        adults and radio stations played music that would appeal to the entire 
        family.</p>
      <p>In the 1950's, records began to change with the development of new technology 
        that led to both the 33 rpm record and the 45 rpm record. The advantage 
        of the new technology was that more musical information could be put on 
        a record, and it was of higher technical quality. Thus, the 33 became 
        popular because more music could be put on a 33 than several 78's and 
        it sounded much better. The 45's were much smaller in size and contained 
        one song on each side. These, as you might guess, were called singles. 
        Not only were 45's much cheaper to buy than the old 78's and the larger 
        33's, but they could be played on a small record player that could be 
        purchased inexpensively by a teenager and kept in his or her room. </p>

      <p>This meant that there were now two markets for music, one for adults 
        who bought mostly 33 rpm records and continued to play them on console 
        phonographs and the other for young people, who bought mostly 45's and 
        played them on small phonos in their rooms.</p>
      <p>Also during this period, the &quot;transistor radio&quot; was invented 
        and became popular. This meant that radios became much smaller and much 
        less expensive, and like the small phonographs soon found their way to 
        young people's rooms. Car radios were also becoming more popular, and 
        more people were listening to the radio while driving. For a long time, 
        the radio was an expensive option in a car. It is hard to imagine a car 
        without a radio today, just as sometime in the not to distant future, 
        it will be hard to imagine a car without a telephone. But in the 1950's 
        radios were just beginning to become standard equipment in cars.</p>

      <p>Radio stations began to program their music to fit the demographics of 
        a new audience. The audience, which until the early 1950's was a pretty 
        homogeneous audience, now was divided into segments with different interests 
        and people listened to music in a number of places, including their cars. 
        This all meant that some radio stations played music for adults and some 
        stations played music for the teens.</p>
      <p>Not surprisingly, young people were tired of the music their parents 
        listened to and they started to look for something new. The white teens 
        of the major metropolitan areas such as New York, Chicago, Detroit and 
        Los Angeles began to turn to the stations that played music they had never 
        heard before. It turned out that the music being played on the &quot;black&quot; 
        radio stations in those cities was Rhythm and Blues (R&amp;B). This music, 
        was of course, familiar to the black population in America, but was brand 
        new for many whites. Since the white audience was so much larger than 
        the black audience, radio stations and record companies released that 
        a major shift in listening patterns was about to occur, and in order to 
        keep the white audience, as well as to appeal to the black audience, they 
        needed to broadcast and promote R&amp;B, or something like R&amp;B.</p>
      <p>Big Joe Turner's song &quot;Shake, Rattle and Roll&quot; began to be 
        played on the white stations. The white record companies started looking 
        for white acts (in the foolish belief, soon to be proved wrong, that white 
        kids wouldn't buy records by black performers) that played something resembling 
        R&amp;B. Groups like Bill Haley and His Comets (originally a country band 
        called the Saddlemen) and soloists like Elvis Presley brought a strong 
        country background to the music, and this combination of R&amp;B and Country 
        became Rock and Roll.</p>
