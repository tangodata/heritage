      is difficult to trace the history of tango, but at the same time, it is 
      quite arduous to avoid doing so, since many visitors to this site have solicited 
      at least a basic outline that will shed some light on this complete cultural 
      phenomenon -dance, music, song and poetry- which, for one reason or another, 
      attracts many people. 
      <p>Although the facts about tango and its personages are often discussed 
        and subjected to scrutiny, it is generally accepted that tango was born 
        in Buenos Aires toward the end of the XIX century. Nevertheless, some 
        prefer to say, for conciliatory purposes, that it was born on the banks 
        of the R&iacute;o de la Plata, in order to please the Uruguayans who claim 
        co-paternity of the phenomenon.</p>
      <p>It is impossible to pinpoint a precise date of birth for a manifestation 
        of popular origin and, therefore, one of evolutionary birth such as tango. 
        However, what is certain is that most experts agree that the decade of 
        1880 was a starting point for what was then no more than a particular 
        way of dancing to music. The society into which tango was born listened 
        and danced to havaneras, polkas, mazurkas and an occasional waltz, as 
        far as the whites were concerned, while the blacks, 25% of the population 
        of Buenos Aires in the XIX century, moved to the rhythms of the candombe, 
        a type of dance in which couples refrained from intertwining and danced 
        in a way that was determined more by the percussive beat than by the melody.</p>

      <p><font color="#D5140F"><big><font size="4" color="#FFCC00">M</font></big></font>usically 
        speaking, tango is related by genealogy to the Hispano-Cuban havanera 
        and is thus&nbsp;<img src="../Historia/musicos1927.jpg" height=326 width=221 align=RIGHT alt="August Sander">progeny 
        of the mercantile transactions between the Spanish speaking ports of La 
        Havana (Cuba) and those of Buenos Aires (Argentina). Nevertheless, these 
        origins explain little abut its birth. Initially, tango was interpreted 
        by modest groups consisting only of a violinist, a flutist, a guitarist 
        -and at times without the latter- and accompanied by an experienced blower 
        who set the beat playing a comb converted into a wind instrument by way 
        of a cigarette rolling paper. The mythical concertina was not incorporated 
        into tango until a few decades later, in the year 1900, approximately. 
        Little by little, this instrument substituted the flute.&nbsp; </p>
      <p> At first, tango must have been a way of interpreting already existing 
        melodies, upon which other newer ones were created, although initially 
        there was no written music since most often than not the interpreters 
        and creators did not know how to read or write sheet music. In fact, with 
        the passage of time, some of the first recorded tangos were not signed 
        by the authentic authors but rather by clever characters who did indeed 
        know how to write down music and took advantage of the existing void of 
        authorship of certain popular tangos to put their own names on them, thereby 
        earning a few extra pesos.&nbsp; 
      <p> <font color="#D5140F"><font size="+2" color="#FFCC00">P</font></font>erhaps, 
        at this point in the text, some readers may wonder about the origin of 
        the name. It is a good question, but one lacking an answer or, what amounts 
        to the same thing, having thousands. In the Spain of the XIX century, 
        the word tango was used for a genre of flamenco; there are some place-names 
        in Africa called tango, in Spanish colonial documents the vocable is used 
        in reference to the place where the black slaves celebrated their festive 
        meetings... some even say the origin could reside in the fact that the 
        Africans were incapable of pronouncing the word 'tambour' correctly and 
        uttered 'tango' instead. All in all, it is a good question but the irremissible 
        lack of written documentation as well as the agraphic origin of tango 
        and its forefathers, will forever hush the answer.

      <p>The figures speak for themselves: Argentina grew from a population of 
        two million in 1870 to four million twenty-five years later. Half of that 
        population was concentrated in Buenos Aires where the percentage of foreigners 
        reached %50, and which was also the migratory destiny of inland Gauchos 
        and Indians.

        this environment, down in the slums and brothels, a new dance began to 
        a new rhythm, and was associated from the beginning with bawdy-house ambiences, 
        since the only women present in the dance academies or dance halls were 
        prostitutes and 'barmaids'.&nbsp; 
      <p> Since they were females dedicating their souls, and above all, their 
        bodies to accidental companions, tango commenced as a dance which was 
        very &quot;corporal&quot;, provocative, close, explicit... in a hardly 
        sociably acceptable manner, something which would become apparent as it 
        spread into an emerging phenomenon and began to expand outside the slums 
        of the city of its origin.

        its humble birth to its elevation as reigning dance in the salons of the 
        occidental world, tango traveled an interesting round trip journey between 
        the Old and the New Continents, with a decisive and brilliant layover 
        in Paris. 
      <p>How did it get there? The answers to this question are also disparate 
        and varied. Some texts, many more ingenuous then erudite, go so far as 
        to offer first and last names of &quot;the&quot; person responsible for 
        this trip. Actually, in its expansion as in its birth, the causes were 
        more complex and, indeed, more plural.</p>
      <p>The elite youths of Buenos Aires did not hesitate to go down to the slums 
        to have fun, dance and, while at it, to pick up some 'mine' or milonguita 
        who was enticing or who let herself be enticed. And to approach the unknown 
        woman, nothing better than a tango. Of course, the tango was neither accepted 
        in their homes nor could it be danced by the young ladies of their milieu 
        and, for this reason, it remained marginal and lower class for many years.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the trips of these patricians to Europe, especially to 
        Paris, lit the fuse. Paris was not only the capital of glamour and fashion, 
        it was also a city which nurtured a plural society, part of which was 
        gay and unprejudiced. The gallant dances of the French capital came from 
        way back when; Louis Mercier, chronicler of Parisian life, wrote in 1800:&nbsp;<img src="../Historia/paris1911.jpg" height=281 width=387 align=RIGHT alt="Jacques Henri Lartigue Paris 1911">&quot;Apart 
        from money, nowadays dancing is the most popular thing among Parisians, 
        whatever their social standing may be: they love dancing, they venerate 
        it, they idolize it... It is an obsession no one escapes&quot;. If this 
        was so at the beginning of the XIX century, it was also so at the beginning 
        of the XX century when public locals such as the Bal Bullier of Montparnasse 
        or the Moulin de la Galette experienced exorbitant fame. In addition, 
        at the turn-of-the-century, boldness was not as out of pace with the Parisian 
        customs as it had been before. Some annual dances, such as the students' 
        Bal des Quat'z Arts, &quot;were famous for the scantness of the garments 
        worn and the raving sexuality always reigning there&quot;. </p>
      <p>Within this social context, it was not difficult for the daring dance 
        created in the Silver Capital to find a terrain fertilized for its blooming 
        and conversion into an oddity at first and a furor afterwards. Once in 
        Paris, the European trend setter, the capital of fashion, the cradle of 
        chic, its extension to the rest of the continent first, and then to the 
        entire world, was easy and quick. Ironically, it is not until then, when 
        Buenos Aires takes a look at itself in Paris, that tango finally enters 
        into the most noble salons, guaranteed by the European baptism, and becomes 
        the best of all pedigrees for an emergent bourgeoise struggling to make 
        of its city the Paris of America&nbsp; </p>
      <p> <font color="#ff0000"><big><big><font size="4" color="#FFCC00">G</font></big></big></font>lory 
        also brought simultaneous rejection. The eternal social dynamic was set 
        into motion, the old against the new, censorship against openness, tradition 
        against renovation. Foes of tango surfaced everywhere and some of them 
        were famous and distinguished. Pope Pio X forbade it, the Kaiser prohibited 
        it for his officials and the Spanish magazine La Ilustraci&oacute;n Europea 
        y Americana spoke of it as the &quot;...indecorous and by all means reproachable 
        'tango', a grotesque ensemble of ridiculous contortions and repugnant 
        attitudes, seemingly impossible to execute, or even witness, by someone 
        who at all esteems his personal dignity&quot;. The quotation comes from 
        that particular Spanish magazine, but it is easy to find other similar 
        ones in English, German and even French publications. 
      <p>However, when the reaction arrived, the die was already cast: tango had 
        triumphed. There were tango dresses, tango colors, tango teas... tango 
        was the number one dance of that prewar world which was destined to end 
        very soon with the first worldwide conflict, the rise of the United States 
        as a world power and the transformation of customs. Afterwards, tango 
        stayed alive, tango songs were born strong, taking the place of the tango 
        dance, but with a more limited success, geographically speaking. The world, 
        in a new prewar period, discovered and admired Carlos Gardel and, at the 
        end of the conflict, the supremacy of the United States disembarked in 
        Europe with the swing that only died to make way for rock.</p>
      <p>All these years, tango has a brilliant history of limited booms and relative 
        declines and a continuous life throughout which both the dance and the 
        music have been developed so thoroughly that it has reached a level of 
        sophistication and purification that makes clear the maturity of a manifestation 
        now living the first decades of the second century since its birth.</p>
