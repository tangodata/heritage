      <p>Bellydancing is the last vestige of goddess worship in the Middle East 
        and is in danger of becoming extinct. Bellydancing began as ritual for 
        childbirth preparation in the ancient Middle East. Before Islam and Christianity, 
        when the Mother Goddess was worshipped, sex and childbearing were sacred. 
        During this time, many societies were matriarchal, and bellydancing was 
        performed by women for women.</p>
      <p><b>Bellydancing Origins</b><br>
        In Arabic, the dance is called Raks Sharqi, meaning &quot;Oriental Dance&quot;. 
        Bellydancing was later translated from the French Danse du Ventre, or 
        stomach dance, which was used to describe tribal dances from a group of 
        matriarchal Berbers in Algeria called the Oulid Nail. Bellydancing is 
        not the only dance done by women in the Middle East. There are regional 
        folkloric dances which also emphasize hip and abdominal movements. However, 
        bellydancing is the most popular well known international dance.<br>

      <p align="left">The dance was done with many layers of colorful clothing, 
        belted at the waist. No skin showed. The dancers bounced layers of skirts 
        by tilting their pelvises violently.</p>
      <p align="left">There is an old tradition rarely seen of young men bellydancing 
        in long, unrevealing robes with a scarf tied around the hips. They danced 
        in coffee houses, strictly for the enjoyment of men, who were excluded 
        from women's gatherings. To this day, Middle Eastern men exhibit a fascination 
        for the dance, and for participating in this ancient women's art.</p>
      <p align="left"><b>The Middle East Restrictions</b><br>
        Today many Middle Eastern countries forbid women to perform the dance. 
        During the 1950's, bellydancing was declared illegal in Egypt. After a 
        popular uprising ensued, the government repealed the ban with one condition 
        -- that dancers no longer show their stomachs. (That law still remains 
        in effect.)</p>
      <p align="left">Why is bellydancing being stopped? Dallal, a professional 
        Mideastern dancer, thinks, &quot;The anti-bellydancing sentiment and reactionary 
        religious extremism was beginning when I visited Cairo. The bellydance 
        shows were not decadent in any way, but the dancers had such charisma 
        and strength that the audience was compelled to silence by the lift of 
        a dancer's arm driven to frenzy by a dancer's union with the drumbeats. 
        I think the Arab men are afraid of the tremendous power in the hands of 
        women when they perform this dance.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">Recently, radical Islamic fundamentalists have succeeded 
        in removing bellydancing from televised programming, and they terrorize 
        restaurants and nightspots that feature the art. Famous dancers that performed 
        the art have either retired or moved to other countries. In 1893, the 
        promoter of an Egyptian music and dance group at the Chicago World's Fair 
        became concerned because nobody was interested in seeing the dancing show. 
        It occurred to the promoter to rename the performers Bellydancers. Thus 
        renamed, the dance created a controversy that became a media sensation. 
        Lines gathered around the block, eager to witness the outrageous act of 
        Bellydancing.</p>
      <p align="left">In the U.S., women are becoming involved in this very ancient 
        dance. Bellydancing is used as a way of celebrating woman's femininity, 
        as it helps women gain confidence in their bodies. Bellydance exercises 
        are also used in natural childbirth classes, and a recent survey done 
        by Mideastern Dancer Magazine reports that women who bellydanced delivered 
        their first child with shorter periods of labor.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Bellydancing acts as an aid to exercise as the sweat and gentle nature 
        of the hip movements help one to stay fit. Women who bellydance are having 
        a lot of fun and feel young at heart!<br>
