        IThe performance dance form known in the West as the Belly Dance, is based 
        on one of the social dances native to the Middle East. In Palestine, this 
        social dance is called Raks Baladi, and is performed by people of all 
        ages and both sexes during festive occasions such as weddings and other 
        social gatherings for fun and celebration. It is the theatricalized version, 
        performed by male (such as Jim Boz and Tito) and female (such as Morocco 
        and Belly Dance Superstars) professional dancers and called Raks Sharki 
        in Arabic, that is most popular in America today.</p>
      <p>In its native lands boys and girls learn the dance from an early age. 
        As with all social dances, it is learned informally through observation 
        and imitation of their elders during family and community celebrations, 
        as well as during informal gatherings with friends. Today, Middle Eastern 
        dance classes are offered throughout the world, and skilled dancers are 
        able to share their knowledge of the dance during studio classes and workshops.</p>
      <p>The exact origin of this dance form is actively debated among dance enthusiasts, 
        especially given the limited academic research on the topic. Much of the 
        research in this area has been done by dancers attempting to understand 
        their dance's origins. However, the often overlooked fact that most dancing 
        in the Middle East occurs in the social context rather than the more visible 
        and glamorous context of the professional nightclub dancers, has led to 
        an overall misunderstanding of the dance's true nature and has given rise 
        to many conflicting theories about its origins. Because this dance is 
        a fusion of many dance styles, it undoubtedly has many different origins 
        -- many of them in ethnic folk dances.</p>
      <p>Many dancers subscribe to one or another of a number of theories regarding 
        the origins of the form. Some of these theories are that the dance form:</p>
      <p>descended from dances in early Egypt <br>
        descended from a religious dance Temple Priestesses once practiced <br>
        had been a part of traditional birthing practices in the region(s) of 
        origin <br>
        had spread from the migrations of the Romani people (also called 'Gypsies') 
        and related groups, with origins in India. <br>
        Of the theories, the first explanation is rarely invoked, even with such 
        high-status proponents as the Egyptian Dancer Doctor Mo Geddawi promoting 
        it. Much of the support for this theory stems from the similarities between 
        poses in Egyptian artwork and the modern dance moves.</p>
      <p>The most well-known theory is that it descended from a religious dance. 
        This idea is usually the one referred to in mainstream articles on the 
        topic, and has enjoyed a large amount of publicity. 1960s American Singer/Dancer 
        Jamila Salimpour was one proponent. It was also popularized in works such 
        as Earth Dancing and Grandmother's Secrets.</p>
      <p>The &quot;birthing practices&quot; theory covers a sub-set of dance movements 
        in modern Raqs Sharqi. Strongly publicized by the research of the dancer/layperson 
        anthropologist Morocco (also known as Carolina Varga Dinicu), it involves 
        the rework of movements traditionally utilized to demonstrate or ease 
        childbirth. Although lacking an &quot;origin point&quot;, this theory 
        does have the advantage of numerous oral historical references, and is 
        backed by a commentary in the work The Dancer of Shamahka.<br>

      <p>Two points suggest Roma dance as its origin. The Roma , and other related 
        groups, are seen as either having brought the form over as they traveled, 
        or picked it up along the way and spread it around. Thanks to the conflation 
        of Roma forms of dance into the Raqs Sharqi sphere in the West, these 
        theories enjoy a vogue in the West that is not necessarily reflected in 
        their origin countries -- although some of that may be due to strongly-held 
        prejudices against the Roma.</p>
      <p>Whatever the origin point, dance has a long history in the Middle East. 
        Despite the restrictions in Islam regarding portraying humans in paintings, 
        there are several depictions of dancers throughout the Islamic world. 
        Books such as The Art and Architecture of Islam 650-1250 show images of 
        dancers on palace walls, as do Persian miniature paintings from the 12th 
        and 13th centuries.</p>
      <p>Outside of the Middle East, raqs sharqi dancing was popularized during 
        the Romantic movement in the 18th and 19th centuries as Orientalist artists 
        depicted their interpretations of harem life in the Ottoman Empire. Around 
        this time, dancers from different Middle Eastern countries began to exhibit 
        such dances at various World's Fairs; they often drew crowds that rivaled 
        the technological exhibits. Some dancers were captured on early film; 
        the short film &quot;Fatima's Dance&quot;, was widely distributed in the 
        nickelodeon movie theaters. It drew criticism for its &quot;immodest&quot; 
        dancing, and was eventually censored due to public pressure.</p>
      <p>Some Western women began to learn from and imitate the dances of the 
        Middle East, which at this time was subject to colonization by European 
        countries. Mata Hari exemplifies the issues surrounding these activities; 
        despite posing as a Javanese dancer, her mystique is linked not to Indonesian 
        dance but to the Middle Eastern dance forms. The French author Colette 
        and many other music hall performers engaged in &quot;oriental&quot; dances, 
        sometimes passing off their own interpretations as authentic folkloric 
        styles. The great dancer Ruth St. Denis also engaged in Middle Eastern-inspired 
        dancing, but her approach was to put &quot;oriental&quot; dancing on the 
        stage in the context of ballet, her goal being to lift all dance to a 
        respectable art form. (In the early 1900s, it was a common social assumption 
        in America and Europe that dancers were women of loose morals.)</p>

      <p>Historically, most of the dances associated with belly dance were performed 
        with the sexes separated; men with men and women with women. Few depictions 
        of mixed dancing exist. This practice ensured that a &quot;good&quot; 
        woman would not be seen dancing by anyone but her husband, her close family, 
        or her female friends. Sometimes a professional dancer would go to a women's 
        gathering with several musicians and get the women up and dancing. Today, 
        sex segregation is not as strictly practiced in many urban areas, and 
        sometimes both men and women would get up and dance socially among close 
        friends in a mixed function. However, while social dancing during acceptable 
        circumstances such as family functions is accepted and even encouraged, 
        there are many people in Middle Eastern and North African societies who 
        regard the performances of professional dancers in revealing costumes, 
        for mixed audiences as morally objectionable. Some have even gone so far 
        as to suggest that such performances should be banned.</p>
      <p>Because the most popular venue for the dance remains night clubs, (as 
        well as the proliferation of video and DVD recordings of popular Egyptian 
        dance celebrities), it is this version, rather than the folk or social 
        versions of the dance that is most popular. The costume now associated 
        with this dance is called bedlah in Arabic (meaning &quot;uniform&quot;) 
        and was adopted by dancers in Egypt in the 1930s, from where it spread 
        to other countries in the region. It owes its creation to the harem fantasy 
        productions of Vaudville, Burlesque and Hollywood during the turn of the 
        last century, rather than to actual authentic Middle Eastern dress. An 
        enterprising night club owner in Cairo named Badia Masabni is credited 
        with the adoption of this costume due to the fact that this was the image 
        that Western tourists came to expect, rather than the native costumes 
        which covered and concealed the contours of the body, with only a scarf 
        or belt tied around the hips to highlight the movements.</p>
      <p>The mainstays of costuming for these styles include a fitted top or bra 
        (usually with fringe of beads or coins), a fitted hip belt (again with 
        a fringe of beads or coins), and leg coverings that include harem pants 
        and/or skirts (straight, layered, circular, or paneled). In the U.S. a 
        &quot;veil&quot; may also be used; this is a three-and-a-half to four-yard 
        piece of fabric that is used in part of the dance to move about and frame 
        movements for the dancer. In the 1940s King Farouk of Egypt employed Russian 
        ballet instructor Ivanova to teach his daughters, and it was she who first 
        taught the great dancer Samia Gamal to use the veil to improve her arm 
        carriage. Most Egyptian dancers use the veil as an opening prop which 
        they discard within </p>

      <p align="left">the first few minutes of their routines, while many Western 
        dancers wil l use the veil for an entire song. In Egypt, night club dancers 
        will also wear full beaded dresses, called baladi dresses, to do the folkloric 
        routines. These types of outfits are also used by American and European 
        dancers when performing folk dances such as the Cane Dance, or the Candelabra 
        dance.</p>
      <p>Most of the basic steps and techniques used in belly dance are circular 
        motions isolated in one part of the body; for example, a circle parallel 
        to the floor isolated in the hips or shoulders. Accents using &quot;pop 
        and lock&quot; where a dancer either shimmies or makes a striking motion 
        in her shoulders or hips are common, as are feats of flexibility, rolling 
        one's belly muscles, balancing various props like baskets, swords or canes, 
        and dancing with chiffon or silk veils.</p>
      <p><br>
        <b>Raqs Sharqi</b><br>
        Despite its western name (&#147;belly dancing&#148;), Raqs Sharqi uses 
        movements in every muscle group of the body. It is, fundamentally, a solo 
        improvisational dance with its own unique dance vocabulary that is fluidly 
        integrated with the music&#146;s rhythm.</p>
      <p>Raqs Sharqi dancers internalize and express the emotions evoked by the 
        music. Appropriately, the music is integral to the dance. The most admired 
        Raqs Sharqi dancers are those who can best project their emotions through 
        dance, even if their dance is made up of simple movements. The dancer&#146;s 
        goal is to visually communicate to the audience the emotion and rhythm 
        of the music. This is especially apparent during the drum solo portion 
        of a performance.</p>
      <p>Many see Raqs Sharqi as a woman's dance, celebrating the sensuality and 
        power of being a mature woman. A common school of thought believes that 
        young dancers have limited life experience to use as a catalyst for dance.[citation 
        needed] Sohair Zaki, Fifi Abdou, Lucy, and Dina are all popular Egyptian 
        dancers above the age of forty.</p>
      <p>Despite the fame of female dancers, men often perform Raqs Sharqi as 
        well.</p>

      <p align="left">Egyptian-style belly dance is based on the work of belly 
        dance legends Samia Gamal, Tahiya Karioka, Naima Akef, and other dancers 
        who rose to fame during the golden years of the Egyptian film industry. 
        Later dancers who based their styles partially on the dances of these 
        artists are Sohair Zaki, Fifi Abdou, and Nagwa Fouad. All rose to fame 
        between 1960 and 1980, are still popular today, and have nearly risen 
        to the same level of stardom and influence on the style.</p>
      <p>Though the basic movements of Raqs Sharqi have remained the same, the 
        dance form continues to evolve. Mahmoud Reda is noted for incorporating 
        elements of ballet into Raqs Sharqi and his influence can be seen in modern 
        Egyptian dancers who stand on relev&eacute; as they turn or travel through 
        their dance space in a circle or figure eight.</p>
      <p>In Egypt, three main forms of the traditional dance are associated with 
        belly dance: Baladi/Beledi, Sha'abi and Sharqi.</p>
      <p>Egyptian belly dance was among the first styles to be witnessed by Westerners. 
        During Napoleon's invasion of Egypt (the campaign which yielded the Rosetta 
        stone, leading to the translation of Egyptian hieroglyphics), Napoleon's 
        troops encountered the Ghawazee tribe. The Ghawazee made their living 
        as professional entertainers and musicians. The women often engaged in 
        prostitution on the side, and often had a street dedicated to their trade 
        in the towns where they resided, though some were quasi-nomadic. At first 
        the French were repelled by their heavy jewelry and hair, and found their 
        dancing &quot;barbaric&quot;, but were soon lured by the hypnotic nature 
        of their movements[citation needed].</p>
      <p>The most important non-Egyptian forms of belly dance are the Syrian/Lebanese 
        and the Turkish.</p>
