I teach and dance the genuine Argentine Tango social dance as it is danced in Buenos Aires and the Milongas (a social dance) around the world.

I teach new dancers to be comfortable with many styles of the social dance: Milonguero or Club Style often called “Close embrace” whether through the shared axis or the independent axis, as well as the open figure style of dancing with a fluid embrace.

[ArTango, Lahr, Germany](http://www.artango.com)
In meinen Kursen kommt es mir vor allem auf die Vermittlung eines authentischen Tanzgefühls und auf die Fähigkeit zu einer intensiven Kommunikation zwischen den Tanzpartnern an. Dies bedeutet konkret, daß zuerst die Grundtechniken (Haltung, Gleichgewicht, Körperspannung) und das Gefühl des Tangos (Musik zu hören und in Tanz umsetzen) erlernt werden. Dabei steht im Vordergrund, sich schon bald auf der Tanzfläche mit dem Partner sicher zur Musik bewegen zu können, ohne sich zu sehr auf festgelegte Schrittkombinationen konzentrieren zu müssen. Denn Tango ist die Verschmelzung zweier Körper, die von der Musik über das Parkett getragen werden.

Der Tango argentino lässt Hugo nie wieder los. Er folgt ihm in die Städte seines Ursprungs: La Boca San Telmo, Avenida Corrientes, Monte Video und Jahre später auch Paris, London, Berlin, Amsterdam. Durch den Kontakt mit den damals noch wenig bekannten Tangolehrern und Tänzern Mingo Puliese, Raúl Bravo, Antonio Torado und Juan Estébes (Petroleo) angeregt, beginnt in ihm ein unerschöpflicher Prozess der kreativen Auseinandersetzung mit dem Tango Argentino. Er entwickelt eine Strukturierungsmethode, in die seine Kenntnisse der Anatomie und des Ballets einfließen.

Our technique is based on the natural movement of the body, using points of reference, understanding balance, body awareness, clear movements and coordination one with another and with the music. The role of the follower is as important as the role of the leader. Our technique is based on improvisation, using all the elements of tango. Tango is the expression of the body and soul in every feeling.

We begin with walking and establishing a connection between the dancers before moving on to the vocabulary of tango - the pivots, ochos, barridas, and sacadas which can be combined to form unique expressions of the dance. We emphasise the positive role of both participants so that the dance is not a passive experience for the follower. When tango is danced well, both dancers are leading and both following. We do not teach sequences (figures) but every so often we will do a lesson on them as there are many places in the world that do.

## Rules for the Followers

###### by Elena Pankey

In this present world of strong women, who lead their lives and control all emotional and business movements, it is a very challenging task left for men: to be a leader. Everybody said they should be stronger, smarter, faster, more energetic, and just more. But from their childhood men mostly were raised by mothers, taught by women-teachers, and accustomed to be obediently polite to their wives (not to upset them). Now in such situations some men are leaders, and some others are giving up! Most of them could get very good leading techniques from the tango lessons, but only IF women would learn HOW to be good followers.

The good answer for a happy tango relationship or for a happy marriage is in traditional role of the Tango leader. But, Ladies, let your partner be a MAN. Learn how to be a follower on the dance floor, and during the tango lessons.

Most women consciously or authentically feel that they need leaders in their lives. They feel it, but still try to take too much burden on their shoulders, even in the dance. They are so accustomed to teach, to help, to talk, that they cannot stop doing it even during the perfectly good dance lessons with a good teacher, who also talks.

First: most women need to train themselves NOT TO TALK to a man during the lesson or practice. Learn how to listen. Make an effort to listen silently to the energy that he is trying to project in the frame of the embrace. If men give up tango would never happen.

Tango asks for "mucho macho." It is a man's dance, but it is always about the woman.

However, it was and is about leading by men.

FOLLOWERS: try to give your partner a chance to express himself. Give him a moment on the dance floor to do something on his own, let him make an initiative! It would please him tremendously! THEN, he would feel joy! And THEN he would make you happy!


**RULES:**

1\. Listen to your partner intently

2\. Don't teach him anything even though you might think you know more

3\. Don't talk to him during the lesson or during your practice with him

4\. Don't try to help him by saying HOW he needs to do the step

5\. Try to please him with everything during the practice, and support his effort to learn with you

6\. Follow his lead even though it might be "wrong" or just his experiments

7\. Be willing to go with your man where he leads you on the dance floor

8\. Close your eyes, and read the energy inside the frame

9\. Learn the correct tango techniques (it is equal for both)

10\. Listen to the music while moving with your partner

11\. Don't assume what is next

12\. Learn patterns and be ready should the leader break them for his own interpretation

13\. Don't follow some "fashion" without thinking, and without adjusting the tango style to your own body/mind, and without understanding what each style means!
Every woman can dance only on the Leader's skills.

## Comfort of your partner is a key to your joy

###### by Elena Pankey

The biggest challenged for some competitive dancers is to get a distinctive style (dance, dress, talk, accessory, hair), and create a special image which everybody would remember. For the social purpose of the dancing it is not a goal. The most important to have fun with whatever you do. But all of us usually look to see if people have style or not. Good Tango dancers usually have some style. YOUR OWN style in tango is created from very few elements so that you dance differently than others. You dance it according to the leader's personality and tempo.

Many men come to Milonga because of their desire to find a partner.

But most women want to create and investigate the Tango music. They want to know what they could do with a man and such music. If a leader cannot dance well yet, he can just remain seated during a Milonga, watch and enjoy it.

However, if you want to enjoy dancing, if you want to give the great leading pleasure - study tango well. Then any woman will come to the Milonga to dance with you!

Most women are very fast learners. They "read" the 3-4 combinations that men dance in his first dance with them. If the DJ has put his heart in his music collection and understands what people like to dance, the music might often also be good. But any good music cannot compensate for the uncertainty and the confusion of men, stumbling with the steps, not understanding the space arrangement, and trying to move somewhere without leading skills.

Eventually, with some persistence, everybody can learn Tango steps. But to attain good skills and the freedom of improvisation, people need to make a big investment of time and money in the learning process.
Some private lessons might bring men a better understanding of the clear and precise leading techniques.

The main idea of a talented dancer is to experiment and find some special, only for you, movements from the inside out, rather than trying to imitate somebody else…

Try all that. Then you and your dance might shine during your routine.

## MY TANGO STORY

#### Tango is just a walk with love in your heart

###### By Elena Pankey

All who love Tango have their own Tango stories. I came into this world because of Tango. My mother met her only love (a Greek man) on the dance floor of a small town on the Black Sea, South of Russia. My parents enjoyed dancing Tango. Tango gave them passion and love, and it gave life to me.

Argentine Tango music deeply talks from heart to heart about different sides of life and love. It is constantly changing, and has difficulties, like in real life. My parents did not stay together for a long time, and my mother did not live a long life.

Tango later came to me in several different periods of my life. Only now, looking back, can I connect all these small, separate pieces into a whole picture and see why and how I came to Tango or why Tango chose me.

First, we had a bandoneon at home.

My grandfather Mina brought this strange (accordion like) musical instrument from Germany after World War II. He even tried to teach me to play it.

You need to open it widely and take the air.

It would play the music, if you know which buttons to push. The same button plays one sound when you open it and another when you close it. Also, you need to memorize the sounds and all buttons. It is an instrument for very smart people - he would say. Later I learned how to play the big, real accordion.

Once when I was ten years old, I attended a Young Pioneers summer camp. In the evenings on the dance floor people gathered for dance and talk, and on some days children were allowed to come. Tango was very fashionable at that time.

One night the crowd was especially large and noisy, reacting very strongly to what was happening on the dance floor. I also tried to come closer, but saw just crazy and strange leg movements, doing different tricks under the influence of the exciting and passionate music.

Finally, I could look up and was shocked by the intimate and very close positions a man and a woman.

This couple looked disgustingly sexy.

The contract between the stillness of their upper bodies and energetic leg movements was so strong, that it shocked me. They aroused my interest.

Their heads were slightly turned to the side like they were watching someone inside their embrace. Someone was between them, someone whom they tried to impress, compete with, or seduce. At the end of the dance a man put a woman on his leg and a little lower and posed... And at this last moment with the last chord of music, he suddenly looked directly in her eyes.

They posed and posed. Silence, dream and love mesmerized everybody. Then the whole crowd exploded and yelled.

A man and a woman walked, faded away and disappeared.

The next evening the orchestra started with a Tango. I was invited to the dance floor by a boy and forgot the whole world. He gave me his hand and Tango came to my soul for the first time....

However, I did not dance Tango again for a long time.

My second tango sensation I experienced in California while watching a performance of the Tango Passion, a well-known professional tango company from Argentina. In the intermission, we found an invitation for dance lessons. It was the beginning of my new and strong Tango passion.

Later I tried to watch every show they would bring to California. Then, for several years I persistently trained with some of the great Tango Masters of the world.

I found everything that I did not have in my life there in the most exciting and complicated music of Authentic Tango. In the movements of this dance lies all feelings, all twists and plots of real life. My mother's first love lived forever there.

Tango is about love. My husband's love and generosity brought tango to my real life while we were cruising to Alaska. One evening we enjoyed a show by Las Pampas Devils. The next day we asked Pablo Juan Vino and Hugo Daniel to teach me some stage choreography to dance with them.

Then we fallowed this professional tango - gauchos group for many cruises, and I performed with them on several cruise ships.

Later, in San Diego once again, destiny intervened, and my search brought me back to Tango.

In 2004 was invited to give my Tango lesson before the show Tango Passion at Escondido Center of the Arts. People say: What goes around - comes around. Life made its circle again. I finally got again a chance to learn and dance with Los Ocampo...

Then I opened my own Tango CAMINITO Dance School and began to teach Communications, Energy and Connections in the Embrace of Tango. During my lessons I use some metaphors that precisely talk about the hidden sense of steps. For some special students, tango might open its very special, mysterious world to them.

I feel that tango is a dance with the invisible third person, who is inside our frame, and who we are constantly looking at... –The music is our main partner. How many new discoveries tango hides? Come to learn and dance with me!

## Some Hints On Tango

###### by Elena Pankey

The real Tango occurs when a man and a woman are in harmony with each other, and they dance to the same musical instrument. They need to listen to each other, and to the music, which is their conductor during the dance. But every leader has a different perception and interpretation of the specific Tango music. That is why tango hooks artistic people for a lifetime.

I usually start my new class with a joke: "Gentlemen! I have some news: You have to be leaders in Tango!"

Learning Tango is an endless process, and there is always some challenge in it. The more advanced the man is, the more attention and concentration it takes for the woman to follow him.

In order to be a great leader, to please a partner and give her some joy, a man should learn this incredible dance very intensely, with determination and dedication.

During our lessons we give the historical explanation of some movements. Also, we use many different images to help people to understand the steps. It brings great fun to our lessons. For example, "a big boleo" (leg makes a circle behind the standing leg) might have come from men's fights, when they tried to clean some space behind them without looking back. A special Tango walk with torque, for example, came from the 19th century, when this dance was born in Buenos Aires. Men "danced" or walked with the music ready to fight or protect a woman from others.

Some hints on tango techniques: A strong frame and good posture by the leader is 90% of the dance.

A leader should not ever move his left arm!

He should not lean forward or backward, but should keep the upper body straight up, without breaking the waistline.

Whatever we do in Tango, our knees are flexed a little but never locked!

Don't keep your weight on the heels; walk with your toes forward, carefully placing the feet on the floor, and all the time face your woman. This is your main lead, gentleman!! Your walk forward should look like somebody holds you behind and tries to pull you back, while you are trying to escape from that person. For example, to walk inside the woman straight forward, you would first put her weight on her left leg. At the beginning, for the first walking step, you will give her impulse, then raise your knee and touch her knee. She moves her leg and gives you some space. Then you stretch your right leg forward with your toes first, in a position of "parada" or "promenade position." At the same time, you still keep the other leg bent slightly. Your weight is, at that point, on your bending leg. Be sure that one knee is behind the other one. So, you should have a shape of a triangle between the legs. You are slightly in a position like you want to sit down, with your spine vertical to the floor.

This is what keeps good balance for many advanced movements.

You then move your body to the middle, with your weight equally on both feet. Then you move your weight onto your leading leg, which you then relax as your other leg stretches forward in a new position of "parada" or "promenade position."

Most of us watch men's footwork: how smoothly the feet caress the floor, how skillful are the pivots, how precise are the steps, leads, or technique. Women want to choose a partner with whom it would be interesting to investigate new challenges and attain some joy of Tango.

A good dancer makes any woman look good.

A woman cannot make up the dance for a man, because he is a leader and the first creator of the Tango design. Leaders need to improve their ability to make fast decisions during the two minutes of Tango. When a leader has a vast active Tango vocabulary, he will be able to improvise and build his own Tango.

This is why it is so interesting to watch dancing couples; they are all different creators.

Enjoy your Tango. It is the "powerful NOW"!

## Communication in Tango

###### by Elena Pankey

Tango was born at the end of 19th century in Buenos Aires and Montevideo from combinations of many dance elements from different cultures. At that time many men from all over the world came to Argentina looking for work and new opportunities. They were strong, adventurous and courageous people; some of them were criminals escaping from justice in their homelands.

In the beginning Tango was communication for people experiencing the lonely life of immigrants. It still is a way of silent dance communication.

Men (porteños) would work hard at the docks on the Rio de la Plata, save some money, and then go to a dance hall or brothel to buy some time or a dance with a woman. For some men at that time two minutes of a dance could cost a fortune. This dance was around a woman and for her. It was expensive, and it was a challenge. Competition between the men often led to fights. While dancing, they held their woman tight with the right arm, protecting her. The left arm was always available for handling a knife. This left arm was not important for the dance, and a woman never relied on it.

Since women danced with many different men without set patterns (like we have now) they were led by watching the chest of their partner. Women would look over the man's left shoulder giving him a signal if somebody was approaching from behind. This still is the etiquette of Milonga!

All men were looking for consolation, comfort, and excitement… for a woman. There were not enough available women; some were pricey and spoiled. Men practiced with each other the moves from their national dances in order to improve their skills. For example, Europeans brought from fencing the most common movements in tango: "corte" and "parada." These two positions every Tanguero still needs to recognize in many steps because they are crucial for authentic expression.

Much later the dance took a specific form and became more elegant. Tango became more acceptable to the middle class, and men could take their own wives to dance on Wednesdays at a dance hall.

At the beginning of this new dance, a little orchestra tried to accommodate, please and help people to move with the music. Two or three musicians would be very skilled and fast to improvise, and their improvisation was dictated by what a dancer did with the legs. This is why tango music is changing all the time. It is a life story in sounds. Unfortunately, this first "Tango music" was not written down, but there might have been some masterpieces. Later the record companies brought some echoes of the original versions of that music to our days.

Tango never ends, nor does the process of learning it. It does not matter whether you are a teacher or an advanced dancer; you just go from one level to another. We think that private lessons are the most effective approach to fast progress in Tango-life, because we use a very particular way of teaching communication. Also, we feel that some special people with fire in their hearts, with dreams in their eyes, with love for this life, will always learn tango faster.

Tango is like traveling: the more you know about it, the more it tells you that you are at the beginning of your road. Moreover, dancing tango is like writing a book: nobody can hide his or her personality while doing it. When we read something, we see the vocabulary and usage of the words, the style and structure of the paragraphs. We see the author behind the description of the subject. The same happens in tango. There are many different styles in tango, different teaching techniques. When a teacher has good knowledge and a clear understanding of tango history, development, and tango techniques, that teacher should have very pleasant and clearly structured lessons. As someone once said in ancient times, "With clear thinking comes clear teaching."

Dancing and learning tango has different meanings and purposes for different people. Recently, a lady wrote to me and said, "Hi Elena! We are Chinese. But I've loved to listen and dance Tango since I was 10. You again re - open for me a new world of tango. How could we become the members of Tango Caminito Company? Alan and I like how you are teaching. Your instructions are very clear and easy for us to learn! We appreciate you. Thanks for your excellent teaching technique." Alice and Alan Chau, Orange County, California

Whatever we do in our lessons or shows is for the joy and pleasure of all. Sometimes, with apologies to Shakespeare, I say, "Tango is life; life is a theater. Tango is a theater of your life." We like to tell jokes during our lessons and watch people laughing and enjoying themselves. That is the best reward for a good teacher.

Since tango is a relationship therapist, we like to teach couples with established communication, and help them to improve it. When couples are learning, practicing and dancing tango together they have a way to a better, longer, and more beautiful life! We say to them, "Tango is just a walk with LOVE in your heart. It means that a leader, at all times during the dance, needs to think about the comfort of his lady. But it is a two-sided coin; the lady needs to listen to the energy impulse that he sends, as a part of his lead, to her. Tango is like making love; a man is never in a hurry! He leads, then waits for a woman to finish her move, and then he leads her to other things again." If people listen to each other during the dance, they will learn more about each other.

Ladies, even some who like to control, are looking for a confident man-a leader. They don't like men who doubt, either in life or in tango. If the gentleman understands where he is going, if he is not confused with his own decisions, ladies will enjoy dancing with him.

My student at San Diego Champion Ballroom Academy, Edy Lange, from La Jolla, who began to learn to dance in Vienna in the forties wrote to me: "Elena, you are teaching with such joy and enthusiasm! It is a joy to be in your class. I am telling you that because I see also that you both are tremendous business people. I love your way of teaching that is why I come. Thank you." People come to learn tango for many different reasons. Most of them are motivated by the incredible images from tango movies, by the beauty of the music, or by an atmosphere of romance and nostalgia… we think that the passion for Tango is the hidden, unconscious desire for eternity. And once again, we are teaching these special people who feel the music, and deeply understand the powerful present moment of our life!

## Position and Meaning of Ladies Head in the Closed/Open Position

###### by Elena Pankey

The closed or open position has nothing to do with the position of the follower’s head in most cases. For some who learned the history of Ttango movements, it is obvious that everything that we dance has historical, psychological or sociological meaning. When you dance with a man, choose what to dance with him, think about the meaning of the steps.

1\. Lady’s head is looking over the man's RIGHT shoulder. (Use ONLY when you both have almost the same height). This position is NOT a characteristic of the close embrace. It is NOT useable for short ladies with a TALL partner!

MEANING: a girl does not care about her partner, does not want to face him, have anything in common with him, does not want to be involved emotionally with this specific man; and might be looking for somebody else behind him.

2\. Ladies head is looking over the man's LEFT shoulder ("a window of the dreams").
Her chin is up, and parallel to the floor (but not DOWN; she should NOT look to the floor). This position is used for ANY partner's heights.

MEANING: friendly, polite welcome to communicate; I don't care about other men right now; I am with you to investigate three minutes of this music. This position says: we could go together in one and the same direction, as a union.

However, the position of the head is the personal choice of the woman. The close or open embrace historically was and still is HER personal choice. Tango is a very intimate dance, besides just a “fun” dance. It is NOT exercise with the music. If a woman does not want to be intimate with a partner (during these 3 min), she chooses the open embrace; she chooses the distance between her and the leader.

The man should not force her, he should not insist on a close embrace with every unknown female. Tango was born not in a family business, but in the brothels.

Women who wanted to be hugged danced in a close embrace.

Others, who wanted to just experiment with the movements, or were waiting for somebody else, danced in the open embrace.

Moreover, for some skilled dancers, the open - close embrace would be changed all the time during the different movements. Some movements demand a closer embrace and others should be danced in open embrace (when right arm and hand of the leader slides to the left side of the woman).

In any case, it is a very technical question which should be well taught - or at least historically explained.

Often some students come to our lessons from other places. Recently, I asked one lady to explain to me why she keeps her head over her husband's right shoulder. She said that in such position her "neck is less tired".

## Tango Leading Technique

###### by Elena Pankey

Leading technique has different levels and stages. They are all good to know and use for the understanding of the language of tango and the comfort of dancing it. There are several leadings techniques exists during the dance, but not only one for one style. However, in any style the most important to develop and focus on a strong frame, which has main leading strength.

**First,** men turn his upper body _or his torso to the direction_ where he wants a follower would go. The followers, who studded the tango techniques, know the first rule of it: follow the upper body of a leader.  However, turning the upper body of the leader gives only a pivot to a follower. But it does not have an indication for a step yet.

**Second lead** is a lead for a movement: _leader changes his body weight_ from one leg to the other on the spot or during the progressive movements. That weight changing makes followers change the body weight as well with a leader together.

A **next leading technique** _is to use right arm_, which should be always parallel to the dance floor. That right arm of a leader moves from the right side of a follower (close embrace) to the left side of the follower (_open embrace_), depending on the steps.
When a follower feels the fingers of a leader right arm on the back (shoulder blades), she take it as a strong leading techniques and one type of a connection.

For some specific movements men use the palm of his right hand for leading her to one direction and his fingers for leading her back to the opposite direction (as in an ocho, for example).

In any style of tango it is important to have a strong frame (space where a leader controls follower’s movements). Leaders could achieve it by NOT moving the left bend elbow (and hand holding women’s right hand) back or behind the left side.
Second, leader’s whist should not be very close to the chest, to the heart. The wrist should be in the middle of two bodies, between two bodies. The left arm bending in the elbow creates equal triangles between the shoulder and the wrists and from the wrist to the chest. When one of the equal sides of those triangles changing the space, the frame is suffering, as well as balance and followers comfort.

As a result of a weak frame you all lose the pleasure of dancing together as one.
