[Dvora Kanegi](http://www.TangoArtist.com)
Tango Passion took hold of me when we met two Springs ago. I go to milongas with my black and red shoes and my drawing pad. I dance until my feet hurt, then I draw into the magic hours, when the dance floor thins and the dancers float about as if in another world. I draw very quickly without looking at the paper. The lines flow from my hand, directed by my eyes following the dancers and by my body still warm from dance.

Cruel en el cartel is a stroll in Buenos Aires guided by the woman's image on advertising bills and signs.

The film uses the language of the video clip, but with documentary essence, because its object is to show the town with a different view. Cruel en el cartel is part a larger project integrating other musical themes.

[Kiss and Tango](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/30/AR2005063001592.html)
Review by the Washington Post. Marina Palmer's chatty memoir of her adventures in the Argentine capital arrives at what seems to be a propitious time. HBO has shelved "Sex and the City," "Desperate Housewives" is in reruns, and the American appetite for vicarious sensuality is being only partly sated by a new series that features ballroom dancing. "Dancing With the Stars," in which professional ballroom champions pair with vaguely familiar "celebrities" to trip -- make that stumble -- the light fantastic, has been a hit since it began airing last month. So Kiss & Tango, a frank, explicit diary of an attractive young woman's many amorous and terpsichorean couplings, seems ideally poised to fill a gap in the zeitgeist.
