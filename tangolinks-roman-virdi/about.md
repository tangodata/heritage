# About

**The [**Tango Link Directory**](http://tango.romanvirdi.com)** contains a collection of Tango-related links.
It is non-commercial and does not charge for inclusion.
Relevant link suggestions are welcome.


**What's the [**Tango-List Library**](http://tangolinks.romanvirdi.com) about?
**This site is a searchable, threaded library of Tango-L, a lively discussion forum devoted to Argentine Tango topics ([tango-L.com](http://tango-L.com))There's so much information that I'd reckon there are some gems lurking here for everyone. The library is updated about once or twice a month.

**Any Other Questions?
**Just contact me. I'll be glad to help.
