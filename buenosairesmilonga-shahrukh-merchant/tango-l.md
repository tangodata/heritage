## Tango-A Updates (May 2015)

\[Note that the rest of this website has not been updated to reflect these two news updates, and that will be done in due course.\]

1.  The Tango-A list will be discontinued as a separate list as of 1 June 2015. Tango-A posts may be made to the Tango-L list. You may see the full article announcing this at the archive [http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.recreation.dance.tango.tango-a/19702](http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.recreation.dance.tango.tango-a/19702)

2.  Speaking of archives, the Tango-A list has now been fully archived with all historical articles reconstructed from the inception of the list in 1999. You may find the archives at one of the following two locations. Both sites have exactly the same information and articles, but they have different presentation styles and you may prefer one over the other, so try them both out and see which you prefer. They both have search facilities, or you can just browse by date or topics.

## The Tango-L and Tango-A Mailing Lists

The Tango-L and Tango-A lists are the longest-running international Internet mailing lists related to the Argentine Tango. Tango-L is a discussion list for discussion of any aspect of the Argentine Tango and Tango-A is an announcement list for major Tango events worldwide. Tango-L was founded in 1995 and Tango-A was created in 1999 to separate the (largely non-commercial) discussions on Tango-L from announcements of events by their organizers on Tango-A. They have played a significant role in making the Tango world smaller.

## What are these lists?

The Tango-L and Tango-A lists are the longest-running international Internet mailing lists related to the Argentine Tango. Tango-L is a discussion list for discussion of any aspect of the Argentine Tango and Tango-A is an announcement list for major Tango events worldwide. Tango-L was founded in 1995 and Tango-A was created in 1999 to separate the (largely non-commercial) discussions on Tango-L from announcements of events by their organizers on Tango-A. They have played a significant role in making the Tango world smaller.

Membership is open to anyone. The list is unmoderated, although conformance to the [list rules and policies](#Rules) (mostly common sense and a restatement of netiquette) is expected and enforced where necessary as list administrator time permits. Membership in each list is about 1000, and posting volume varies between 5 and 25 messages per day (a daily digest is available for those who prefer their Tango in fewer but larger doses).

Tango-L and Tango-A are complementary lists and most subscribers choose to subscribe to both. Tango-L is interactive and often opinionated and more like a discussion forum. Tango-A is for announcements -- while any member can post there, postings are typically announcements made by event organizers or occasionally queries by travellers seeking Tango in various parts of the world that they may be travelling to. Tango-A has a "topics" option that allows subscribers to receive postings limited to their geographical area of interest, but again most subscribers choose to receive all (presumably because they have an interest in knowing what's going in elsewhere in the Tango world).

## Subscribing and Unsubscribing

You can **subscribe** to the list in one of two ways (Tango-L and Tango-A are independent as far as the list management software is concerned and need to be subscribed to individually):

- **Recommended.** Visit the list website at [http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/tango-L](http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/tango-L) (for Tango-L) or [http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/tango-A](http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/tango-A) (for Tango-A) and follow the instructions. Basically, you enter your e-mail address and full name, and you may also choose a password (or be assigned one) for later administration of your membership. You can also choose whether you want to receive messages individually as they are posted, or have them compiled in a daily "digest" and mailed to you once a day.

- Alternatively, you may subscribe the old-fashioned way by sending an e-mail message to **[Tango-L-request@mit.edu](mailto:Tango-L-request@mit.edu?subject=subscribe)** or **[Tango-A-request@mit.edu](mailto:Tango-A-request@mit.edu?subject=subscribe)** with the word **_subscribe_** in the subject field or the body of the e-mail. There are many other command-line messages with a plethora of options for the nostalgic amongst us who prefer them to the web interfaces (where you can of course achieve the same thing). Send the command _**help**_ to the _\-request_ address above to get a complete list.

You can **unsubscribe** to the list in one of two ways as well (Tango-L and Tango-A are independent and need to be unsubscribed from individually)::

- **Recommended.** Visit the list website at [http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/tango-L](http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/tango-L) (for Tango-L) or [http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/tango-A](http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/tango-A) (for Tango-A) and follow the instructions. If you have forgotten your password (which you will need, along with your e-mail address, to unsubscribe), there is an option for having it e-mailed to you.

- Alternatively, you may send an e-mail message to **[Tango-L-request@mit.edu](mailto:Tango-L-request@mit.edu?subject=unsubscribe)** or **[Tango-A-request@mit.edu](mailto:Tango-A-request@mit.edu?subject=unsubscribe)** with the word **_unsubscribe_** in the subject field or the body of the e-mail.

In either case, there are options to unsubscribe an e-mail address other than the one you are sending the e-mail from, if you know the password or have access to that e-mail account.

## List Rules, Policies and Guidelines

**Personal attacks of individuals (also called _ad hominem_ attacks) have proven to be the most disruptive, with many subscribers leaving the list as a result. Hence, violators of this rule are subject to removal without notice.**

The usage rules below for the Tango-L list have basically remained unchanged since 1995, when the list was created, except for edits in 1999 to reflect the formation of Tango-A, and minor clarifications and formatting modifications since then. Owing to limited administrator bandwidth, these rules are not always or uniformly enforced; _however, they continue to be in effect_. Even aside for the violation of the "no personal attacks" rule stated above, repeated or intentional abusers of _any_ of the rules may be removed without notice. (Limited time availability by the volunteer administrators does not allow them to the luxury of enforcing all the rules, nor of handholding the most flagrant abusers.)

**Tango-L:** Please **[click here](tango-L-rules.htm)** to see the detailed posting and participation rules for Tango-L.

**Tango-A:** Please **[click here](tango-A-rules.htm)** to see the detailed posting and participation rules for Tango-A.

## How to Post to the List

You have to be a member of the list to post to it. Once you are a member, send e-mail to [tango-L@mit.edu](mailto:tango-L@mit.edu) to post to Tango-L, and to [tango-A@mit.edu](mailto:tango-A@mit.edu) to post to Tango-A. Note that the list address (Tango-L@mit.edu or Tango-A@mit.edu) _must_ be in the To: or Cc: field of your email, i.e., "Blind Carbon Copies" are not allowed. Also, the Tango-A list requires that the Subject line start with a geographical prefix (SA, NA-E:, NA-C:, NA-W:, EU-E:, EU-W:, AASP: or MISC:) otherwise it will not be distributed properly. Make sure you read the [Tango-L and Tango-A rules](#Rules) for detailed instructions before posting.

The list accepts only plaintext (non-HTML) mail and, for protection against viruses, etc., and to keep the size of the e-mails and archives manageable, no attachments either. You may feel free to provide links in your e-mail postings to web sites with relevant photos, etc. If you send HTML mail, it may be held owing to its size being too large, or it may be automatically reformatted into plaintext with unpredictable results.

## List Archives (Obsolete ... to be Updated to point to Current Archives)

The Tango-L and Tango-A lists have been archived by Lucy Lynch at [http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-L/index.html](http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-L/index.html) and [http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-A/index.html](http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-A/index.html) respectively, since 2001, and it is expected that this will continue even with the existence of the Mailman archives (see below). This archive is accessible to anyone.

In addition, however, the Mailman software also provides for automatic archiving of lists hosted by Mailman. Since the Tango-L and Tango-A lists were moved to the Mailman software (from Listserv, where they were hosted from 1995) in April 2006, the Mailman archives exist only from May 2006 onwards. These archives may be found at [http://mailman.mit.edu/pipermail/tango-l/](http://mailman.mit.edu/pipermail/tango-l/) and [http://mailman.mit.edu/pipermail/tango-a/](http://mailman.mit.edu/pipermail/tango-a/) respectively, and are also publicly accessible. If you can't find them there, go to the main list homepage at [http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/tango-l](http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/tango-l) or [http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/tango-a](http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/tango-a) and there will be a link to the list archives at the top.

## Information for Webmasters

_If you have a web site that has details on subscribing to Tango-L and Tango-A, list rules, etc., you may now point instead to this site, which will always have the latest information about these lists. Recommended basic text is as follows, but of course you may use your own variation and commentary if you'd like:_

> "**Tango-L** and **Tango-A** are two long-running and popular worldwide Internet mailing lists for the Argentine Tango that have existed since 1995. Anyone may subscribe to these lists. **Tango-L** is for discussion about any aspect of Tango, and **Tango-A** is for announcements of major Tango events by region. Please go to **www.Tango-L.com** for details about these lists, how to subscribe, list policies, etc."

**Q. How do I unsubscribe, check my subscription or change my list options or subscriptions?**

**A.** Here are the step-by-step instructions:

1.  Go to the [Tango-L](http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/tango-l) administrative page at [http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/tango-l](http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/tango-l) (and/or the [Tango-A](http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/tango-a) administrative page at [http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/tango-a](http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/tango-a), depending on which list(s) you want to check or modify your subscription for.

2.  At the bottom of the page, enter the email address under which you are subscribed and click on the "Unsubscribe or Edit Options" button at the bottom of the page. (If you cannot remember the email address under which you are subscribed, see the FAQ article on [Difficulties in Unsubscribing](#FAQ-Unsubscribe).)

3.  On the next page you will be prompted for your password. If you don't remember it, you can click on the "Password Reminder" button and it will be emailed to you at the address you specified (assuming that that address is, in fact, subscribed to the list). If you can no longer receive email at that email address, see the FAQ article on [Difficulties in Unsubscribing](#FAQ-Unsubscribe). If you're pretty sure that you are subscribed under the email address you entered but still don't get the password reminder, check your Junkmail or Bulkmail folder, and set your spam filtering options to allow all mail from mailman \[@\] mit.edu, mailman-owner \[@\] mit.edu and mailman-bounces \[@\] mit.edu.

4.  Once you are successfully logged in, you can check your options, unsubscribe, change to or from the digest mode, and other fun options if you are into that sort of thing. Most of the options can be changed globally, i.e., you can specify them to apply to both Tango-L and Tango-A (and any other lists at mit.edu that you are subscribed to -- not likely unless you are an MIT student or affiliate).

**Q. I am trying to unsubscribe from the list following all the instructions and I can't. Get me off!**

**A.** If you followed all the [instructions for unsubscribing above](#FAQ-ChangeOptions), and still cannot log in to your account, search your old email for an email with subject " **mit.edu mailing list memberships reminder**" sent from "**mailman-owner \[@\] mit.edu**". This will have a list of all the lists you are subscribed to at mit.edu, the email address with which you are subscribed, and the password associated with each subscription. This should allow you to log on and unsubscribe in the [previous FAQ entry](#FAQ-ChangeOptions).

If you cannot find this email, or deleted it, send an email to tango-L-owner@mit.edu with _(a)_ your full name, _(b)_ the list(s) you wish to be unsubscribed from, _(c)_ all possible email addresses or variants under which you could have been subscribed, _(d)_ a forwarded email with headers of mail you are receiving from each list from which you wish to be unsubscribed, and the list administrator will take care of it for you.

**Q. I have a new email address and I want to change it in the list. How can I do it?**

**A.** Log on to your subscription page for changing your options following the [steps described above](#FAQ-ChangeOptions). The very first section allows you to change your email address, and includes a checkbox to apply that change to all other lists at mit.edu that you happen to be subscribed to. This is much better than unsubscribing and resubscribing, as _(a)_ it is much faster and _(b)_ it preserves all your settings (digest, topics for Tango-A, etc.).

**Q. How do I send mail in "plaintext" (whatever that is) as opposed to HTML (whatever _that_ is)?**

**A.** The Tango-L and Tango-A lists discourage the use of HTML or formatted email (with colours, bold text, etc.) so as _(a)_ to emphasize the content and not the excessive use of typography or visual hyperbole and _(b)_ to reduce the size of digests, archives and postings in general, and for better compatibility with mailers. Unfortunately, most contemporary mailers default to formatted or HTML mail composition. You have to find the option in your mail sending program to turn off formatting (many mail programs allow you the option of setting the preference of individual entries in your address-book to "formatted" "unformatted" mail, so set up the Tango-L and Tango-A posting addresses in your address-book with those preferences, or set it globally to "plaintext."

There is a more detailed discussion of this subject, along with detailed instructions on how to do this for seemingly every possible mailer out there, at [http://www.expita.com/nomime.html](http://www.expita.com/nomime.html). Here are our instructions for selected mailers (if you use a different one and would like to add instructions for your mailer to help other users who use that mailer, please email these instructions to tango-L-owner@mit.edu  and they will be incorporated here):

_**Google Mail Beta:**_ On the Compose page, if a formatting bar (font selections, etc.) appears below the Subject: field, click on "« Plain text". (When it shows "Rich formatting »", you are correctly in "Plain Text" mode.)

_**Mozilla Thunderbird 2.0:**_ Tools > Account Settings > Composition & Addressing. Uncheck the box that says, "Compose messages in HTML Format." Alternatively, go to Tools > Options > Composition > General > Send Options > Plain Text Domains. Under Text Format, select the option, "Convert the message to Plain Text."

**_Netscape Mail 7.1:_**  Edit > Preferences > Mail and Newsgroups > Send Format. Select "Convert the message to plain text" and under "Plain Text Domains," add **_mit.edu_**. Alternatively, go to Window > Address Book > New Card and create address book entries for Tango-L@mit.edu and Tango-A@mit.edu, specifying "Plain text" under the "Prefers to receive messages formatted as:" option.

**_Yahoo Mail (original):_** In mail window, click Options (upper right) > General Preferences (under Management) > Select "Compose Messages as plain text" (under Composing E-mail). Click Save.

**_Yahoo Mail Beta or New:_** In mail compose window, if a formatting bar (font selections, etc.) are shown below the Subject: field, click on "Plain Text" to the right of the Subject: field. When it shows "Rich Text" to the right of the Subject: field, you are correctly in "Plain Text" mode.

**Q. What are the "geographical prefix" letters like "NA-E:" that appear in the Subject of Tango-A postings and why do I need them?**

**A.** Every posting to Tango-A (this doesn't apply to Tango-L) _must_ be preceded with a prefix (SA:, NA-E:, NA-C:, NA-W:, EU-W:, EU-E:, AASP: or MISC:) that indicates the part of the world that the event being announced is being held. (This is sometimes referred to as a "Topic" as well.) If this is not included, the posting will likely not be distributed to the majority of members on the list. The format of this prefix must be exactly as written above (in upper case followed by a colon and a space) and then the subject. And it must be one of the above list -- you cannot invent your own prefix even if you think it makes more sense. See the [Topics section at the Tango-A rules page](tango-A-rules.htm#Topics) for further details, including the table that maps the prefix to the relevant area of the world, if you plan to or are trying to post to Tango-A.

**Q. I tried to send a message to the list and got a automatic reply saying that I am not allowed to post to the list! Why is that? I've been a member of the list for ages!**

**A.** The lists only permit postings from those who are members of the list. If you are a member of the list, the mostly likely explanation for the rejection is that you are trying to post from a different email address than the one under which you are subscribed. Perhaps your university or company changed the way your email looks when it goes out (from jsmith@company.com to john.w.smith@company.com, for example). The list software has no way of knowing that these are the same person. See the FAQ entry on [Changing your list options](#FAQ-ChangeOptions) to check your current subscription. You can change your email address there, or if you wish to have the option of posting from multiple email addresses, while still receiving your list mail to only one of them, you can subscribe _all_ the addresses to the list, and sent all but one of them to "Nomail" so you do not receive multiple copies of list mail.

The other (less likely) possibility is that you were actually automatically unsubscribed from the list because your email was bouncing (perhaps owing to a full mailbox or a server problem at your end). The list processor requires several bounces over a period of several days to unsubscribe someone so you would have had to have a pretty serious mail delivery problem for this to happen. [Check your subscription](#FAQ-ChangeOptions) to see if this happened and resubscribe (possibly under a more reliable email ID).

**Q. My mail to the list did not appear on the list and I got no explanatory message or rejection. What happened?**

**A.** There are several possibilities. Here are various possibilities, from most to least likely:

- You _did_ get an explanatory message but your spam-catcher was set too aggressively and filtered it. Check your Junkmail or Bulkmail folder, or set your spam filtering options to allow all mail from mailman@mit.edu, mailman-owner@mit.edu and mailman-bounces@mit.edu.

- You sent an email to Tango-A but did not include the geographical prefix (SA:, NA-E:, NA-C:, NA-W:, EU-W:, EU-E:, AASP: or MISC:) or entered it incorrectly. In this case, the mail _does_ get sent to everyone who has a digest subscription even though it didn't match any topics (since digest subscribers get all topics), so it is not flagged as undeliverable even though it in fact was not delivered as intended. Hence, you didn't get an error message back. Check the [formatting of the geographical prefix at the Tango-A rules page](tango-A-rules.htm#Topics), and resubmit if that was the problem.

- Your list options are set _not_ to receive a copy of your own postings. This is unlikely but possible, since it is not the default option and you would have had to change it explicitly in your subscriptions options. Furthermore, most subscribers _want_ to see a copy of their own postings so are unlikely to set this option. But it's a possibility, so you can [check your subscription options](#FAQ-ChangeOptions) to see if this is the case.

**Q. I am subscribed to the list but am not receiving (or have stopped receiving) email from the list.**

**A.** There are several possible reasons. Here they are, along with possible solutions, in order of likelihood:

- Mail from the list is being filtered by your spam-catcher of mail filter. Check your Junkmail or Bulkmail folder, and if that was the reason, set your spam filtering options to allow mail from the Tango-L and Tango-A list(s). How to do this depends on the particular spam catcher, but the easiest way is to allow any mail that has the words Tango-L or Tango-A anywhere in the header. If you need to be more specific, all mail from the Tango-L list should have the email address **tango-L \[@\] mit.edu** in the To: or Cc: field, and all mail from the Tango-A list should have the email address **tango-A \[@\] mit.edu** in the To: or Cc: field.

- If you were having persistent problems with your email delivery, it is possible that you got unsubscribed from the list, or had your subscription suspended (a intermediate state before you get unsubscribed). To check this, do the following: Log on to the list server to check your subscription options [as described above](#FAQ-ChangeOptions). If the system does not recognize your email address, you got automatically unsubscribed and you will have to resubscribe to the list. If you can log in, check at the top of the welcome page just below your name to see if there is a message regarding messages bouncing from your address. Then further down on the list, check to see that your "Mail Delivery" option is set to "Enabled." If not, set it to "Enable" and click on the "Submit My Changes" button at the bottom of the page.

- If neither of these is the problem, then it could be a third issue that has sometimes cropped up: The domain **mit.edu** somehow gets tagged as a blacklisted domain by certain ISPs, who stop delivering mail originating from **mit.edu**. It is almost never intended (after all, mit.edu is an educational domain and as such does not fit the profile of a spam organization). Check with your ISP's customer service line (good luck!) if this is in fact the issue. Copy the list administrator at tango-L-owner \[@\] mit.edu on this email as well so that we are aware of this potential problem.

**Q. "The message's content type was not explicitly allowed"**

**A.** If you get this message, this means that the post was rejected automatically by the server (the list administrator will never know that this happened, so you should email tango-L-owner \[@\] mit.edu if you cannot resolve this problem). In general, this happens when you send email in HTML format and not in plaintext format (although it does not happen _every time_ you do this ...). Send the message in plaintext (see [related FAQ article](#FAQ-Plaintext)) and that should solve your problem.

**Q. I changed my mind about a posting I made (or said something embarrassing that I now regret, or is coming back to haunt me) and want to make it go away!**

**A.** Hmm, you didn't read the section in the list posting rules [that addressed this topic](tango-L-rules.htm#POLICY-Privacy). The short answer is that the email certainly cannot be withdrawn once it is sent and distributed. In addition, the list is [archived](#Archives) in more than one Google-searchable location, some of which are private archives that the list managers have no control or jurisdiction over. If you believe you have a strong-enough case, you would need to contact the owners of each of these archives (basically wherever you get a hit for your posting on Google) and request or persuade them to remove the posting. You are not likely to be 100% successful, but some may accommodate you.

**Q. My mail to the list did not appear on the list and I got an email saying it was sent to the moderator for approval. Why are my posts being moderated and those of others not?**

**A.** The Tango-L and Tango-A lists are "lightly moderated," i.e., most members' posts go directly to the list without delay and without needing approval by the moderator. However, persistent and / or intentional and/or severe violators of the list rules may have their postings screened (there are generally just a small handful of those at any given point in time). A full explanation of How the Tango-L List is Moderated may be found at this article that was posted to Tango-L, but a summary of all the reasons that your post may be moderated appear below (most of them -- those in Category (1) -- are innocuous technical reasons).

1.  **Category 1**. A "normal" reason that has nothing to do with the content of your posting _per se_:

    - **You just joined the list.** New members to the list (this includes those who resubscribed under a different email address) are automatically put on moderation status. This is mainly to avoid spammers who sometimes subscribe to lists in order to spam the entire list (although it does have the effect of catching most "newbie" errors also). If it is a legitimate posting, it will be approved, usually within 24 hours or less, or you will get a response explaining any modification you need to make before resubmitting it. After a few legitimate postings, your moderation status will be cleared and your messages will go through immediately.

    - **Message too large.** There is a limit of 5K (about 5,000 characters) on list messages. That's about 100 lines of text and even the most verbose and rambling poster rarely writes that much. So either you have _(a)_ sent the message in [HTML format](#FAQ-Plaintext) (which easily quadruples the size of the message) or _(b)_ tried to include an attachment (photo, etc.) to the message (see list rules on [No Attachments](tango-L-rules.htm#FORMATTING-Plaintext)) or _(c)_ you have quoted unnecessarily from a previous message (see list rules on [Limiting Quoting](tango-L-rules.htm#FORMATTING-DontQuote)). You can fix this problem, cancel your posting (if the moderator didn't already reject it), and resubmit. In the event that you truly _did_ have a really long plain-text article of several hundred lines (there have been a few), the moderator will automatically accept it, but you can send an email to Tango-L-owner \[@\] mit.edu pointing this out if you wish.

    - **"Blind Carbon Copies not allowed" or "Too Many Recipients in the List."** The list address (Tango-L@mit.edu or Tango-A@mit.edu must appear in the "To:" field of your email message. If you are sending a mass mailing that includes Tango-L or Tango-A and your mailer does not explicitly but the list address in the "To:" line, it will be rejected. Similarly, if it _is_ on the "To:" list but with many other email addresses, it will also be rejected. These are among the spam protection mechanisms, and also serves to discourage organizers from adding Tango-A to their regular mailing list. Send a separate email to Tango-L or Tango-A, meeting all its formatting and postings rules, and you should be fine.


2.   **Category 2**. To get the attention of someone who has some relatively minor violation (e.g., unnecessarily attaching the entire previous email), but who seems to ignore the repeated reminders they receive pointing this out. It generally gets their attention when they _have_ to read and act on the reminder email in order for their posts to get through. This is really more like putting someone back in Category 1, since they are newbie type errors, rather than intentional or severe rules violations. Once it is clear that they have figured out how to fix their postings, their moderation status gets removed rather quickly.

3.   **Category 3**. Someone is put on moderated status by the moderator for intentional and/or severe and/or repeated list abuse or rules violations, or for a statement of intent to do so, or for behaviour that indicates that they do not intend to follow the rules. These are the problem members and there are generally just a small handful of them (2-3 if at all) at any given point. They tend to share some or all of the following characteristics:
**_(a)_** generally have an attitude, or indication from their words or behaviour, that they are above the rules,
**_(b)_** tend to take up a disproportionate amount of the moderators' time and have a disproportionately negative influence on the list,
**_(c)_** generally have engaged in extremely disruptive behaviour such as flaming, trolling, rants, etc. (which are strongly enforced -- see the _[Section of the Tango-L list rules on No Flames, Rants, Swearing and Personal Attacks](tango-L-rules.htm#RELEVANCE-NoFlames)_) and
**_(d)_** know that they are in this category from having received multiple or strong warnings.
Their postings are always moderated and for an indefinite period. They do not receive responses to non-compliant posts or often even to their other correspondence until they have agreed in writing to abide by the rules. In some cases, none of their posts are approved anymore (even if they are otherwise compliant) because they have demonstrated a complete disregard for the rules. If you have managed to get yourself into this category, the only way to get your posts approved or even to receive any kind of response from the moderators (other than a request to be unsubscribed) is to send an email to tango-L-owner \[@\] mit.edu stating in an unqualified and sincere manner that you have read the rules and agree to abide by them in all future posts (your posts are still likely to be moderated for a while, probably indefinitely, owing to your past abuses and violation of implicit trust until you have regained that trust).

**Q. Why did I get a reminder or warning about a rule infraction when I see occasionally other posts that have violated that same rule?**

**A.** This could be for one of several reasons:

- Your posts are still being moderated (see the [FAQ entry above](#FAQ-WhyModerated)) so your messages receive more visibility (and hence scrutiny) by the moderator, who doesn't necessarily read all the posts from unmoderated members every day. The other violator would likely have received a warning as well, but in this case it would be after the fact and other list members would usually not know.

- Since the moderators don't necessary read every post or read them every day, some rules violations, even blatant ones, may escape his attention. Yours was probably noticed and/or brought to the moderators' attention while the other wasn't.

In either case, you are encouraged to bring the other offending post to the moderators' attention if you wish, by forwarding a copy of it to tango-L-owner \[@\] mit.edu.

**Q. What if I don't agree with the list rules or the way they are being enforced?**

**A.** Depending on your exact issue, there are different answers:

- Participation in the Tango-L and Tango-A lists requires that you agree to abide by the list rules. If you do not so agree, you are required by the rules to [unsubscribe](#Subscribe) from the list. You may still read posts by others at the [list archives](#Archives). If you feel a rule requires clarification or adjustment you may send a constructive comment to that effect (being as specific as you can regarding the proposed change) and it will be considered for inclusion in the next update -- however, you are still bound by the current rules if you choose to remain a member.

- If you feel the rules are not being adequately enforced, to the detriment of the list, you may send a copy of the violating post(s) and the moderators will take action on it if necessary, and depending on their time and workload. (If you wish to volunteer as a list moderator, you may also indicate your desire to do so and help the time and workload issue.)

- If you feel your posts are being denied _even though they comply with all the rules_, you may send a politely worded explanation of your point of view to the moderators at tango-L-owner \[@\] mit.edu, and they will reply if they accept your explanation. (Make sure you have read the [Tango-L](tango-L-rules.htm) and [Tango-A](tango-A-rules.htm) rules, as well as the article on _[How the Tango-L List is Moderated](tango-L-moderation.htm)_ before you do so.) There is currently no other appeal mechanism. Rude, defiant or abusive emails will not be responded to (and is not likely to further your case anyway).

**Q. I have another question that is not answered on the FAQ nor anywhere else on this website as far as I can tell.**

**A.** Send an email to the list owner at Tango-L-owner \[@\] mit.edu with your question and he will attempt to answer it (and possibly include it on the next edition of the FAQ if others are likely to have a similar question). Make sure to include any supporting email you got (preferably with all the headers) and exactly what you did and what unexpected response (or lack of response) you got. (Just saying, "It didn't work," doesn't give much to go on ...) If your question _is_ on the FAQ but following the steps specified didn't work, be sure to mention this (including all the steps you did in detail and their results), otherwise the list administrator is just likely to point you back to that FAQ entry!
